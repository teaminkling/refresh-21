Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Desc: Silhouette using negative space and texture to bring forward the figure and clothing. For movement, I went more subtle with hair flow that cuts through the face rather than drawn in. Note: save your work&amp;hellip;i lost the first draft and finished this 1 hr before deadline

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes i read a cool tumble post about a botanist burying a lamb bone under a tree and when they came back a few months later the tree had completely absorbed it. Left it to the last minute so it‚Äôs not exactly what I had in mind but better done than not so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes I actually struggled with the theme, but this came suddenly one day ago. Killing of farmers is still an issue in the Philippines as they struggle for genuine and lasting land reform. January 22 was also the anniversary of the Mendiola Massacre, where 13 farmers were killed when police dispersed a large farmer&amp;rsquo;s protest.</description></item><item><title>Blue</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/linalifox-week-4-9594/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/linalifox-week-4-9594/</guid><description>Week 4: Murky Silhouettes.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes I began this piece with a cyan background and started painting in a dark blue. I found it a challenge as I did not have the usual variety of colours to work with, especially with no red tone at all used in the skin. However I eventually learnt to blend the two blues and make them work and thoroughly enjoyed the process.</description></item><item><title>Bog</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/doughyeast-week-4-cdf9/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/doughyeast-week-4-cdf9/</guid><description>The above is an MP4 video link.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes I had the idea to do a cute wild west family portrait featuring the gays(tm) and their daughter, so I went with it! I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to spend as much time on this as I wanted to, but I&amp;rsquo;m still happy with it (also here&amp;rsquo;s a non-monochrome version lol)

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes i really just wanted to create something ambiguous with this piece, no clear expression of good or evil, menacing or innocent completely up to interpretation. &amp;ldquo;movement&amp;rdquo; really got me thinking about the creeping of shadows so i tried to subject that in the piece! i guess it&amp;rsquo;s less of a silhouette but still a retreat into complete darkness/murkiness &amp;lt;:wow:649902323191119882&amp;gt; very last minute but happy with the outcome!</description></item><item><title>Morning Breeze</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/cindry-week-4-2681/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/cindry-week-4-2681/</guid><description>Week 4: Murky Silhouettes.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes &amp;ldquo;Murky silhouettes&amp;rdquo; sounds metal and I got my wisdom teeth out so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t really do what I usually do.
&amp;ldquo;Tone&amp;rdquo; reminds me of a sick and phat guitar toan that has &amp;ldquo;value.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Rhythm&amp;rdquo; obviously means blastbeats and &amp;ldquo;movement&amp;rdquo; means the movement of the head up and down as the music flows through your soul and out your butt.</description></item><item><title>POV you dust off an old VHS tape and slot it in the player‚Ä¶</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/charmandaar-week-4-36cd/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/charmandaar-week-4-36cd/</guid><description>The above is an MP4 video link.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes took a video while i was lightly messing around on the pole and here we are..! thought the glitchy parts would be a fun way to transition between clips. i love playing with silhouettes when i dance and thought this may be a cool idea to encompasses murky shadows and rhythm/movement too.</description></item><item><title>Snap Shot 1</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/av-week-4-3f90/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/av-week-4-3f90/</guid><description>Week 4: Murky Silhouettes.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Desc: Whew, this one was close! Sucks that I had to kinda rush at the end because this was submitted on a school night, but I think it still came out really well! I hope his expression scares you because it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to lol. The only story I&amp;rsquo;ll give is something/someone hurt his boyfriend pretty badly and he&amp;rsquo;s not happy about it.</description></item><item><title>1:21 AM</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/arancil-week-4-ac13/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/arancil-week-4-ac13/</guid><description>Week 4: Murky Silhouettes. This art was lovingly created using: Acrylic paint (Magenta/yellow mix for orange, winsor violet with a bit of magenta for the hand).
Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Tried to capture desperation, intensity and passion. Didn&amp;rsquo;t manage to make the indentations left by the fingers the way I wanted - the idea of the situation is someone digging her nails into the back of her lover.</description></item><item><title>costume change</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/jc-week-4-1490/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/jc-week-4-1490/</guid><description>Week 4: Murky Silhouettes.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes A one minute gesture sketch turned into a monochrome piece where negative space was used to explore values. Internally mad at the anatomy being off but I promised myself to only work from the gesture and not to spend an hour fussing over making the form precise. It was fun erasing to add value though.</description></item><item><title>Fa√ßade</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/vectorong-week-4-b82c/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/vectorong-week-4-b82c/</guid><description>Week 4: Murky Silhouettes. This art was lovingly created using: ink + paper collage.
Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Delving a bit personal with this piece. Often there&amp;rsquo;s a disconnect between the person I present to others - usually my business persona I use for my work that seems to have everything orderly and &amp;lsquo;put together&amp;rsquo;, while my internal self always feels like it&amp;rsquo;s in a state of at least minor chaos and has to navigate the unknown without guidance.</description></item><item><title>Practice</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/kami-week-4-8c00/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/kami-week-4-8c00/</guid><description>Week 4: Murky Silhouettes.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes This is a martial arts style from India called Kalari, it&amp;rsquo;s really aggressive and involves lots of movement. I tried gesture drawing for the first time, so i guess not bad?

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes The Search
Murky, silhouette&amp;hellip; well, I must oblige! (It&amp;rsquo;s like you want me to draw spoopy shit) üòõ Decided to contrast this with my last two pieces by using mainly lighter values. And since we&amp;rsquo;re looking at movement, thought I&amp;rsquo;d try and pump in some more overt narrative stuff too. Enjoy!

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes I thought I could finish this within 2 days (including learning + execution), ended up having to scrap a lot of the ideas due to my lack of knowledge and sleep deprivation. (definitely not my proudest project, bad coding ethics, cutting corners)
