Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Nothing fancy for the last week of the design refresh 2021 as I want to take this time to praise all the wonderful artists that submitted their art. It was only a few month ago that a picked up my first drawing tablet and started digital art (I was so scared to even use colors ðŸ¤£ ).</description></item><item><title>Part of Your World</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/bell-bones-week-17-b157/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/bell-bones-week-17-b157/</guid><description>Week 17: The 4 R&amp;rsquo;s: Finale.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Waaaa, week 17,,, it&amp;rsquo;s here,, and I actually come with a piece of quality (thanks to the extensions lmao). This piece was inspired by @Linalifox&amp;rsquo;s submission for week 4, titled &amp;ldquo;Blue&amp;rdquo;. Their piece reminded me of mermaids, which reminded me of The Little Mermaid and my merman AU that I have for Backey,,, so I drew him and took the pose from the &amp;ldquo;Part of Your World&amp;rdquo; scene in The Little Mermaid.</description></item><item><title>#2021DesignRefresh Portfolio</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/vectorong-week-17-85ff/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/vectorong-week-17-85ff/</guid><description>The image above leads to an external website.

Week 17: The 4 R&amp;rsquo;s: Finale. This art was lovingly created using: E-portfolio (flipbook made on https://fliphtml5.com).
Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes I find it&amp;rsquo;s always nice to look back whenever you complete a series / project and celebrate, so this is my way of doing so - creating a book with all the pieces I&amp;rsquo;ve submitted. I&amp;rsquo;ve really enjoyed this challenge and trying all these new mediums, even when I felt like my brain might explode.</description></item><item><title>Re:create</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/paintsepsi-week-17-ac8e/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/paintsepsi-week-17-ac8e/</guid><description>Week 17: The 4 R&amp;rsquo;s: Finale.
