Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes I looked up the flag of Okinawa and it was perfect with what I had in mind. The man in the center is a sketch of Kamejiro Senaga, one of the pioneers of the peace movement in Okinawa to expel the US bases hosted in the islands. &amp;ldquo;Gui&amp;rdquo; is the title of a composition by Japanese composer Ryuichi Sakamoto created for a feature film about Kamejiro&amp;rsquo;s life.</description></item><item><title>Lonely in the Quartz desert</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/thelagexpert-week-3-8cfa/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/thelagexpert-week-3-8cfa/</guid><description>Week 3: Red Circle.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes lost in the desert, not really what I imagined (was afraid to post it), but will finish it as soon as I get better; it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to give lonely and cold vibes. Will do better next week hopefully.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes The Shogun of Death is a character ive been working on for a while ( i say working, its an idea in my head).

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Sooo, week 3, huh? Due to school and my personal life, this came out rather rushed&amp;hellip; However, I still like the character design I came up with! The background was inspired by a certain rhythm game, kudos to you if you know the one I&amp;rsquo;m talking about ;p

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes DAMN IT DIDN&amp;rsquo;T KEEP THE IN CLIPBOARD WHEN DELETING THE SUBMISSION but from memory:

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes _
Desc: First week where I did stuff, hah! I hope I can start to follow the weeks more now that I exist here. You might recognize the character on the left, and if you do, then you&amp;rsquo;ll know who my friend is lol. These two boyos have a lot of story put into them, and I know a lot more about the Wild West than the average person might suspect.</description></item><item><title>Blood Moon</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/scimister-week-3-c664/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/scimister-week-3-c664/</guid><description>Week 3: Red Circle.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes missed the week 2 prompt but wanted to work on the idea. Been thinking about running my own D&amp;amp;D session and was inspired by the grotesque and unknown of classic creatures and came up with a giant deep sea mimic. Wanted to invoke the idea of an angler fish lure but using red instead of the usual blue/white.</description></item><item><title>Tamago Tama</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/papapastry-week-3-31f0/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/papapastry-week-3-31f0/</guid><description>View on SoundCloud.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Red circle was Japan for me this week. It should be obvious where I went with that in the recording.
To me &amp;ldquo;garnet red&amp;rdquo; meant a very bold sound that&amp;rsquo;s not lowkey at all. Gems are formed under pressure, which to me means heavy distorted guitars, improvisation, garage drums, intentional but fun mistakes in instrument runs, and a very fast tempo.</description></item><item><title>Tesseract</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/vectorong-week-3-f068/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/vectorong-week-3-f068/</guid><description>Week 3: Red Circle. This art was lovingly created using: Vector illustration.
Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Rather than a finalized illustration, I wanted to use this week as a way to push myself to complete a concept art for a story I&amp;rsquo;ve been slowly developing. A lot of the story revolved around shapes with very graphic elements, so I wanted to push that and also do a medium completely different from the previous weeks.</description></item><item><title>The Red Circle</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/zja2damax-week-3-f85c/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/zja2damax-week-3-f85c/</guid><description>Week 3: Red Circle. This art was lovingly created using: Charcoal, Acrylic, and Watercolor on paper.
Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Desc: A photoshopped composition focused around the red circle. The circle is embraced by the hopeful and the hopeless. The circle is prominent in the light and the dark. The circle is constant in each instance. Layered over by each passing entity, immovable from its position.
