Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes I wanted to try play with the rain patterns but rushed them a little. References are godsend. I was going for a minimal editorial look and limited pallette because those are outside of my comfort zone.

The yellow is &amp;ldquo;Gold Star&amp;rdquo; ink from Diamine, the rest is fineliner, uni-ball for white and some cobalt+ultramarine for shaded areas.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes gay rat wedding
I went a bit crazy on SAI which is a huge guilty pleasure. In the end it&amp;rsquo;s a bit cute and a good mood so I&amp;rsquo;m happy with what I made. Looking forward definitely going to use more references since i should, this is a bit surreal.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Basically a portrait of a model but using the Pantone colour of the year as the background. I thought the brightness of the yellow really stood out and so I ended up really appreciating the way it turned out!
(Sorry hope I did this right lol)
