Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes This one was really hard to make, both physically and emotionally. I felt a lot of things doing this. These&amp;hellip; things were borne from both internal and external stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve heard throughout my life. I think&amp;hellip; that&amp;rsquo;s all I can say for now. I might expand on this elsewhere, IDK.
The concept and title is based from a book by Dr.</description></item><item><title>Crazy Bird</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/dynoloafer-week-12-6b6a/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/dynoloafer-week-12-6b6a/</guid><description>Week 12: Visual Words.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes I made it after all, sweet! Anyways, I decided to use a sharp type of typography I&amp;rsquo;ve used in the past to help emphasize the power in this picture. Yes this is the gay cowboys (I draw them both as humans and as people.) No spoilers for part 2, (part 1 is finished) but someone is struck by a smooth criminal.</description></item><item><title>Disappear</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/soleilboo-week-12-f36b/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/soleilboo-week-12-f36b/</guid><description>Week 12: Visual Words.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes English is my second language and I‚Äôm having fun with all suffix and prefix. Google said ‚Äúdis‚Äù = ‚Äúa Latin prefix meaning ‚Äúapart,‚Äù ‚Äúasunder,‚Äù ‚Äúaway,‚Äù ‚Äúutterly,‚Äù or having a privative, negative, or reversing force&amp;hellip;. Also my art always revolving around my daily life so this work inspired by this week little getaway trip&amp;hellip; I‚Äôm disappeared into nature now&amp;hellip;.</description></item><item><title>Exhaustion</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/bell-bones-week-12-62d1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/bell-bones-week-12-62d1/</guid><description>Week 12: Visual Words.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Was going to do something cuter this week and make a lovecore aesthetic piece, buuuut I&amp;rsquo;ve just been,, so tired lately. Mom&amp;rsquo;s been keeping me up until 2 am all week for reasons so I haven&amp;rsquo;t been getting more than 5 hours of sleep per day&amp;hellip; so I decided to convey that through handwritten lettering.</description></item><item><title>Glass House</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/thelagexpert-week-12-f76f/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/thelagexpert-week-12-f76f/</guid><description>Week 12: Visual Words.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes A bit too late cz I am busy with the exams. These are Lyrics from my favourite Song from last year it&amp;rsquo;s called Glass House by Gabbie Hanna, It has a good message behind it (I think), and it has the best music video I have ever seen, check it out if you have time.</description></item><item><title>Just a normal day as an asian girl online</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/cindry-week-12-713c/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/cindry-week-12-713c/</guid><description>Week 12: Visual Words.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes TW: racism, sexism This is a response piece to the experience of being a female online. The quotes are all taken from real messages sent to me on my stream. The use of keycaps represents not only the digital nature of these messages but allude to how anonymous messages are written with magazine clippings.</description></item><item><title>Noodle Bar</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/papapastry-week-12-972c/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/papapastry-week-12-972c/</guid><description>Week 12: Visual Words.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes This week&amp;rsquo;s theme has given me completely free rein on what I wanted to write. I fulfilled the theme entirely through the video. It&amp;rsquo;s visual and it&amp;rsquo;s words innit.
I was going to do kinetic typography but I had ten minutes to learn, which I determined to not be enough time. Songwriting process: noodle two chords, sing in a bathroom, noodle some more.</description></item><item><title>Reach</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/eggyolk-week-12-b350/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/eggyolk-week-12-b350/</guid><description> Week 12: Visual Words.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Throwback to that time I did a graphic design degree. The hardest thing I find when designing is deciding what stupid pointless words to put on the page. I feel like, especially at uni, a lot of words are there to look pretty and have no message.</description></item><item><title>Letter from her</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/wellcookedegg-week-12-bfe9/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/wellcookedegg-week-12-bfe9/</guid><description>Week 12: Visual Words.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes I am not a huge fan of typography so this is my first crack at it. It was ok, maybe not my favorite lol. Though it was a good exercise for sure.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Ever had anxiety or panic and heard the word relax? That&amp;rsquo;s a bit of what I tried to capture here. The inner font with harmful/intrusive thoughts I made from my own handwriting and you can download it (linked in next message) and use it if you like.</description></item><item><title>The Comfy Chair</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/vectorong-week-12-146c/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/vectorong-week-12-146c/</guid><description>Week 12: Visual Words.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Inspired by the range of Italian designer Massimo Vignelli&amp;rsquo;s work, and that &amp;ldquo;If you can design one thing, you can design everything.&amp;rdquo; Often I feel as a designer and artist, we&amp;rsquo;re directed to only learn a specific &amp;ldquo;style&amp;rdquo; of skills, when in reality all your knowledge ends up coming into play in some form.</description></item><item><title>wrod</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/jumpingbeans-week-12-215e/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/jumpingbeans-week-12-215e/</guid><description>Week 12: Visual Words.
