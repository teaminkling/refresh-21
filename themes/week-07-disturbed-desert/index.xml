Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Sort of a composition exercise since I don&amp;rsquo;t normally draw backgrounds. Couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a colour scheme I liked that worked with the monochrome sketch so I kept it minimal.

This art was lovingly created using: Ableton Live 10 Suite.
Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes YouTube External Link (Headphones will benefit you for this song).
&amp;ldquo;Desert&amp;rdquo; to me means the mixolydian mode (a tonal &amp;ldquo;pattern&amp;rdquo;). You know, like The Beatles (Norwegian Wood, I Feel Fine) and a lot of classic rock around that era. &amp;ldquo;Space&amp;rdquo; sounds like space emulation: reverb. The theme also influenced the lyrics greatly, which were written before the music.</description></item><item><title>Hey you!

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes I didn&amp;rsquo;t really get to post many wips for this piece because Discord decided it was too unholy to be seen before it was fully developed, but here it is!

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Scene: Oh no, one of the remnant forces of the humans are being hunted by the reptilian empire led by Hiss Majesty - but the sand starts rumbling and what rises out of it?
Three panel piece, there&amp;rsquo;s some storyboarding done for the pre-first-panel storytelling as well, but cut it down to two of the nicest looking key panels (+ a dramatic final one).</description></item><item><title>SOL 0</title><link>https://refresh21.fiveclawd.com/blog/trixynetex-week-7-f8df/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh21.fiveclawd.com/blog/trixynetex-week-7-f8df/</guid><description>Week 7: Disturbed Desert.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes This morning the Perseverance Rover landed safely in the Jezero Crater on Mars. It&amp;rsquo;s NASA&amp;rsquo;s fifth Rover to land on the red planet and, other than Curiosity, is the only thing &amp;lsquo;alive&amp;rsquo; on the dusty world.
Art wise, a bit of a quick and dirty one. (Was starting to run out of time ðŸ˜…) I used the 3D model viewer of Perseverance to get the rover as accurate as possible.</description></item><item><title>Strange Sands</title><link>https://refresh21.fiveclawd.com/blog/cindry-week-7-78e8/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh21.fiveclawd.com/blog/cindry-week-7-78e8/</guid><description>Week 7: Disturbed Desert.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes I love alliteration lol!
hey isn&amp;rsquo;t is kinda mysterious? I got this idea from when crabs would dig holes at the beach and spit out the water. Finding that in the desert would be super creepy&amp;hellip; also stippling is hard. I do really like this though and hope you do too!</description></item><item><title>The Sandstorm</title><link>https://refresh21.fiveclawd.com/blog/dynoloafer-week-7-8d7b/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh21.fiveclawd.com/blog/dynoloafer-week-7-8d7b/</guid><description>Week 7: Disturbed Desert.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes TW FOR &amp;ldquo;BLOOD&amp;rdquo; (just in case)
This sandstorm is fogging up my judgement. I can&amp;rsquo;t even see you. I can&amp;rsquo;t even see my goddamn hand out in front of me&amp;hellip; Please. Don&amp;rsquo;t blame yourself, none of this is your fault. I was the one who killed them, can&amp;rsquo;t you see the blood?

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes 3 white chocolate caramel souffle cakes to celebrate three different events.
Growth: 1st cake for Herschel&amp;rsquo;s birthday, sadly we missed his birthday party due to lockdown.
Goodbyes: 2nd cake for my roommate who decided his job wasn&amp;rsquo;t worth his sanity anymore and quit.
New Beginnings: 3rd cake for my friend Pete who&amp;rsquo;s moving to a new place!</description></item><item><title>Untitled</title><link>https://refresh21.fiveclawd.com/blog/soleilboo-week-7-911a/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh21.fiveclawd.com/blog/soleilboo-week-7-911a/</guid><description>Week 7: Disturbed Desert.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Everyone have their own desert to carry. And flower can grow in the desert you know ðŸ™‚
Inspiration: orange sand colour of Australian desert and Goodenia-one of Australian desert Plants Combined with my goal of digital portrait painting this year.
Hope you all enjoy this work.
And yes flowers can grow in the desert.</description></item><item><title>Rain Over the Desert</title><link>https://refresh21.fiveclawd.com/blog/zat-week-7-42e5/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh21.fiveclawd.com/blog/zat-week-7-42e5/</guid><description>Week 7: Disturbed Desert.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes @rjmmendoza on IG/Twitter | A1EwanRichards on Twitch
It&amp;rsquo;s not a desert in the typical sense. It&amp;rsquo;s an amalgam of sugar cane farms and the concept of &amp;ldquo;peace of the cemetery,&amp;rdquo; referring to a quote by St. Oscar Romero. The title is a rough translation of a poem by Filipino poet Axel Pinpin, originally titled &amp;ldquo;Kung Puntod na ang Lupa&amp;rdquo; (literal: If the Land is a Tomb&amp;quot;).</description></item><item><title>Seconds in Sand</title><link>https://refresh21.fiveclawd.com/blog/vectorong-week-7-7f38/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh21.fiveclawd.com/blog/vectorong-week-7-7f38/</guid><description>Week 7: Disturbed Desert. This art was lovingly created using: Photography (shot w/ a Canon 40D).
Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes There&amp;rsquo;s often times when I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m in an internal &amp;lsquo;desert&amp;rsquo;, where ideas don&amp;rsquo;t come easily and time slips by. Yet somehow the creative spark is always hovering in between this barren space and the looming deadline, and often I just find myself having to be patient for the right moment rather than to grasp at the sands.</description></item><item><title>Skull</title><link>https://refresh21.fiveclawd.com/blog/paintsepsi-week-7-c59a/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh21.fiveclawd.com/blog/paintsepsi-week-7-c59a/</guid><description>Week 7: Disturbed Desert.
