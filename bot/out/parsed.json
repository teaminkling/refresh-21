The design is influenced by a well known chinese poem: Quiet Night Thoughts by LiBai, it describes looking up at the moon and thinking of one\u2019s family at home.\nI have lightly inked the carving to contrast the details. I have left the seal face (bottom face that is used to stamp signatures) blank.",

I've always been surrounded by paper and origami ever since I was kid, and wanted to pay homage to both my roots and the medium that has so much potential. Also I've been wanting a piece to bring in the two parts of my heritage in one piece; my last name roughly translates to 'ferry across the river' and my chinese name means 'yellow love lotus'.\nSocial Media: instagram - @karen_tsugawa, twitch - @vectorong\ndetail shot so you can see the paper better LOL\n",

Last year, I messaged her, short of spilling my feelings for her, while apologizing for all my awkward moments between me and her. She replied that I shouldn't have to be sorry for it, and even she has had her own realizations.\n\nRecently, she even told me maybe we'd work on a project someday and even referred me to her friend about building a community start up.

Needed green dye to mix into cyan dye and so I made a cactus farm and built a factory around it. uses mostly blocks and stuff you can make from the dyes (also a little stone). Tried to make it look like it pollutes the river (dug out custom rivers and had them flow into the swamp biome for extra dirty effect). Solved the rhythm part by making a noteblock drum-kit in the factory. \nit's a statement because I was inspired by the Citarum river in Indonesia, most polluted village in the world. Also has textile factories.",

Needed green dye to mix into cyan dye and so I made a cactus farm and built a factory around it. uses mostly blocks and stuff you can make from the dyes (also a little stone). Tried to make it look like it pollutes the river (dug out custom rivers and had them flow into the swamp biome for extra dirty effect). Solved the rhythm part by making a noteblock drum-kit in the factory. \nit's a statement because I was inspired by the Citarum river in Indonesia, most polluted village in the world. Also has textile factories. \n\nSocial Media: \nhttps://www.twitch.tv/cup_o_rice",

Oh well, school finals are happening right now and, particularly in math (I'm a grade ahead of my peers in it) homework likes to pile up. But, even if I'm late, I know that this would've came out really bad if I rushed it, so I took my time and.. would you look at that! Apple dragon with an apple <:CattoBlush:800558786372173824> So you know, this creature design is not owned by me; that would belong to the developers of Creatures of Sonaria (it's on Roblox, good game) ((yes I know it's roblox shut up)) But, I *did* make the skin!

The creator of Lugia, Takeshi Shudo, heavily relied on alcohol, pills and even *tranquilizers* to get his mind in the workspace, which sadly isn't an uncommon practice with creators. Lugia was supposedly supposed to only show up in Pokemon: The Movie, but it found it's way in the game. She was supposed to represent *life and maternity. She was supposed to be the Goddess of the Sea, mother of life. Buuut, sadly the details were taken out of Shudo's grasp, and Lugia became a genderless legendary. They even made her a psychic type because, quote \"We wanted to make it more powerful.\"\nIt's disappointing and disheartening to see what happened to this deep-ocean beauty. The bastardizing of Shudo's ideas caused him to fall into a great despair, where he overdosed a few years later. I never knew Lugia's story before, but now that I do, she is the only legendary I look at and feel something. I hope it's the same for you too.

      "description": "My first attempt at digital painting! Meh results, I think.\n\nI tried to recreate this scenery of the Taal Volcano Island in Tagaytay, a popular tourist destination south of Manila, along a steep access road that we crossed during an official business trip where a teammate and I were doing ocular inspections of venues from the recently-concluded 30th Southeast Asian Games.\n\nAt that time, I recently had two breakdowns, and a string of realizations stemming from an office crush. And when I saw the view from our service vehicle, I couldn't help but tear up a little. It was so majestic, and made me realize that I had been so preoccupied with my own self that I've forgotten to \"stop and smell the flowers,\" so to speak. I couldn't be bothered to just... be.\n\nThe title is derived from the text displayed on the original Japanese theatrical trailer for Takeshi Kitano's 1997 movie HANA-BI.",
