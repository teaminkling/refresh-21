Then I decided to add the clay mandrake as a figure that was disturbing the landscape and came across the icing cacti at the shops while getting ingredients.

Oh well, school finals are happening right now and, particularly in math (I'm a grade ahead of my peers in it) homework likes to pile up. But, even if I'm late, I know that this would've came out really bad if I rushed it, so I took my time and.. would you look at that!

The creator of Lugia, Takeshi Shudo, heavily relied on alcohol, pills and even *tranquilizers* to get his mind in the workspace, which sadly isn't an uncommon practice with creators. Lugia was supposedly supposed to only show up in Pokemon: The Movie, but it found it's way in the game. She was supposed to represent *life and maternity. She was supposed to be the Goddess of the Sea, mother of life. Buuut, sadly the details were taken out of Shudo's grasp, and Lugia became a genderless legendary. They even made her a psychic type because, quote \"We wanted to make it more powerful.\"\nIt's disappointing and disheartening to see what happened to this deep-ocean beauty. The bastardizing of Shudo's ideas caused him to fall into a great despair, where he overdosed a few years later. I never knew Lugia's story before, but now that I do, she is the only legendary I look at and feel something. I hope it's the same for you too.
