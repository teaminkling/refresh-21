Not entirely an aesthetic adherence to the theme but more of a compositional one. A morphing of flowing chords with a watery bongo drum (ocean) moves into a Lydian (scale) section. The main focus of the track was about contrast to adhere to "space": the differences between the size of objects in the ocean. As such it's a bit avant garde.

(yeah it's a bit demo/garage quality but i only decided to join the challenge today heh)

Had to redo the whole thing after being unhappy with the first go at it - and I feel like the "SPACE" keyword wasn't given any justice.

**Week:** 3
**Title:** Tamago Tama
**Medium:** Audio (Ableton Live 10)
**Socials**: twitch.tv/papapastry
**Description:**

Red circle was Japan for me this week. It should be obvious where I went with that in the recording.

To me "garnet red" meant a very bold sound that's not lowkey at all. Gems are formed under pressure, which to me means heavy distorted guitars, improvisation, garage drums, intentional but fun mistakes in instrument runs, and a very fast tempo. I took "shape" to mean "shape of a barred chord on a guitar" so I played the guitar. "Contrast" to me meant having a long winding bridge with different soloistic parts.

Feat. a very special guest

**Title:  ** Dancing Cloud
Medium: Digital (Clip Studio Paint)
Description: A one minute gesture sketch turned into a monochrome piece where negative space was used to explore values. Internally mad at the anatomy being off but I promised myself to only work from the gesture and not to spend an hour fussing over making the form precise. It was fun erasing to add value though. also this description doesn't really describe the piece at all now does it so um, it's a prancing horse in white over a blue background.

Title: Fa√ßade
Medium: ink + paper collage
Description: Delving a bit personal with this piece. Often there's a disconnect between the person I present to others - usually my business persona I use for my work that seems to have everything orderly and 'put together', while my internal self always feels like it's in a state of at least minor chaos and has to navigate the unknown without guidance.

Title: Blue
Medium: Procreate
Description: I began this piece with a cyan background and started painting in a dark blue. I found it a challenge as I did not have the usual variety of colours to work with, especially with no red tone at all used in the skin. However I eventually learnt to blend the two blues and make them work and thoroughly enjoyed the process. In the sketch phase I focused on creating flow and movement in this piece through the hair and posture.

**Title**: MURKE SHADOES
**Medium**: Ableton Live 10
**Description**: "Murky silhouettes" sounds metal and I got my wisdom teeth out so I couldn't really do what I usually do.

"Tone" reminds me of a sick and phat guitar toan that has "value." "Rhythm" obviously means blastbeats and "movement" means the movement of the head up and down as the music flows through your soul and out your butt.

"Monochromatic colour" to me means it shouldn't have any melody and "background colour" is "black" as in "black metal."

January 22 was also the anniversary of the Mendiola Massacre, where 13 farmers were killed when police dispersed a large farmer's protest. Landlessness and vestiges of feudalism remains to this day.

Week 6: Simple Love
Title: "Amalgamation: Smile and Smile"
Ink on paper, 9x12 inches.

Description: Another week, another rush job lol. I had an initial idea but I dumped it since I couldn't execute it. I made this just now.

Anyway... I tried to recreate the moment I shared with friend and a crush from around 2015. I earlier sent her a message apologizing for "being weird" (not my words) after being scolded by someone for acting weird towards two girls. I sent both of them an apology message, unfriended one of them, but left the other to decide for herself. To my surprise, a week later (this exact moment), she said she wasn't mad at me, and we even embraced in the rain, much to my surprise. I held her shoulders and instinctively said, "We're still friends, right?"

And we've remained friends ever since. Last year, I messaged her, short of spilling my feelings for her, while apologizing for all my awkward moments between me and her. She replied that I shouldn't have to be sorry for it, and even she has had her own realizations.

Recently, she even told me maybe we'd work on a project someday and even referred me to her friend about building a community start up. She's been so kind to me, it actually disarms me.

The title is derived from a piece by Joe Hisaishi for the movie HANA-BI (Fireworks), directed by Takeshi Kitano.

Week 7: Disturbed Desert
Title: "Resistance 3: When The Lands Become Graveyards"
Medium: Digital (Clip Studio Paint)
Socials: @rjmmendoza on IG/Twitter | A1EwanRichards on Twitch

Description: 

It's not a desert in the typical sense. It's an amalgam of sugar cane farms and the concept of "peace of the cemetery," referring to a quote by St. Oscar Romero. The title is a rough translation of a poem by Filipino poet Axel Pinpin, originally titled "Kung Puntod na ang Lupa" (literal: If the Land is a Tomb").

Title: Three Celebrations (Change)
Medium: Photography, Clay Figure & Cake
Description: 3 white chocolate caramel souffle cakes to celebrate three different events.

Growth: 1st cake for Herschel's birthday, sadly we missed his birthday party due to lockdown.
Goodbyes: 2nd cake for my roommate who decided his job wasn't worth his sanity anymore and quit.
New Beginnings: 3rd cake for my friend Pete who's moving to a new place!

I originally wanted to make a pun on dessert/desert and made a few cakes to replicate the rolling sandy dunes. Then I decided to add the clay mandrake as a figure that was disturbing the landscape and came across the icing cacti at the shops while getting ingredients. I haven't really done much photography so trying to get the shot I wanted took a while but I think it turned out well.

**Medium:** Ableton Live 10 Suite
**Socials:** <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4nay640JrxBZhNMiVIYTFg>
**Description:**

(Headphones will benefit you for this song).

"Desert" to me means the mixolydian mode (a tonal "pattern"). You know, like The Beatles (Norwegian Wood, I Feel Fine) and a lot of classic rock around that era. "Space" sounds like space emulation: reverb. The theme also influenced the lyrics greatly, which were written before the music.

Oh, and the video? Yeah, I dunno.

Alternative title: playing around with Live 11's new cool features.

"High Sheen" reminds me of a few things. Getting high (on life) in a club, shiny lights from the sun and from stage lights, bright, natural naive feelings. "Sheen" of youth, so to speak, and stuff I have nearly no experience with at all. Clubs aren't really clean, kids.

This was a speedrun. I composed, mixed, wrote lyrics, recorded, and mastered everything in 58 minutes. Composition could not haven taken any longer than 10 minutes.

The melody was written using nerd magic and code based on the image file Cindy posted.

Title: Color factory 
Medium: survival Minecraft
Description: 

Decided to use minecraft since I was in quarantine during the vacation and had time. Needed green dye to mix into cyan dye and so I made a cactus farm and built a factory around it. uses mostly blocks and stuff you can make from the dyes (also a little stone). Tried to make it look like it pollutes the river (dug out custom rivers and had them flow into the swamp biome for extra dirty effect). Solved the rhythm part by making a noteblock drum-kit in the factory. 
it's a statement because I was inspired by the Citarum river in Indonesia, most polluted village in the world. Also has textile factories.

"Bold strokes" sounds upbeat, aggressive, complex, and coloured by live instrumentals.

Before the 'rona there was live music. For those who have not been in a crowd or performed contemporary music, there is nothing like it. Every mistake, every ad lib: the energy is secondary to nothing. It is extremely obvious when watching some of the best bands out there that everybody is having so much fun.

I spent an actual long time composing this, but not as long mixing it. Consider it demo quality.

Notes: everything you are seeing you also are hearing (no miming). The guitar at the end was done in one take as I started to panic.

Medium: Fabric / fashion (upcycled fabric, screenprinting, and sewing)
Social media: instagram @karen_tsugawa  |  twitch <@!142176660731592704> 
Description: „Éú„É≠„Éú„É≠ ("boroboro") often refers to an item that is worn out to the point where it is in tatters. Rather than throw it out, I find it can be a very personal and relaxing process to repair it, following similar Japanese repairing idealogy where the fix / mend also becomes a point of beauty. The pattern is based on other traditional Japanese patterns - this is one focuses on the imagery of a bobbin and thread to create an almost water-like pattern, which was screenprinted with gold ink, a reference back to Kintsugi which is a pottery repair technique using gold lacquer.

I also included a comparison image for fun and how you can use non-functionality in fast fashion to your advantage.

Title: Portrait 6: Get Together
Medium: Felt marker on paper, 9x12in

Description: Drew this earlier at the office since our room didn't have internet since yesterday afternoon. I couldn't think of anything nice, but this came to mind soon enough.

The dance is called "tinikling," where a couple dances between two bamboo poles being clapped to the musical beat. It is somewhat similar to a waltz and a mazurka.

Week 11
Title: Undercooled 1: Please Return The Moon To Us
Medium: Felt marker and oil pastel on paper

Description: I first conceptualized a starry universe portrait theme of sorts, but I thought a landscape would be better. This is my first time using oil pastel.

The flying figure is my interpretation of a "bakunawa," a serpent-like dragon in Philippine mythology, who is said to cause various natural phenomena, such as eclipses. It was said that people would shout at the sky, pleading to give the moon back to them during eclipses.

"Undercooled" is derived from a 2005 song by MC Sniper, composed by Ryuichi Sakamoto as his call for the world to "cool down" in the aftermath of 9/11.

As I kept on drawing, it became apparent that, in line with the song's theme, this would be my prayer of sorts for the world, and my country, to "cool down" and for a return to normalcy after a whirlwind year.

**Week:** 11
**Title:** The Island
**Medium:** Music
**Description:**

This song features the feeling of oppressive clouds and weather, harsh harmonies and clashing timbres.

This song isn't "soft" but I wrote it by surrealist writing about the sea, the land, and the sky. I wrote back then: "The concept [is] a man on an island panicking and struggling to survive against the weather and wildlife. He makes it on further and further, surprising even himself. Whether or not he survives is answered by the punctuated and sudden conclusion of the last beat."

(This is an old song of mine. Proper submission next week since this week has been hectic. This song will not appear on the Design Refresh album.)

Title: The "Comfy" Chair
Medium: Ink + Marker, Photoshop
Description: Inspired by the range of Italian designer Massimo Vignelli's work, and that "If you can design one thing, you can design everything." Often I feel as a designer and artist, we're directed to only learn a specific "style" of skills, when in reality all your knowledge ends up coming into play in some form. Combining a typeface (inspired by Quicksand), functionality, and my personal love of multi-use furniture - I bring you the "Comfy" chair. The letters of the word form the wooden frame that allows reclining for use as a chair or a makeshift bed.

Title: Are You Listening?
Medium: Indesign (if you prefer illustrator you can fight me)
Description: Throwback to that time I did a graphic design degree. The hardest thing I find when designing is deciding what stupid pointless words to put on the page. I feel like, especially at uni, a lot of words are there to look pretty and have no message. I wonder if that just means I have nothing to say? (How can I be so opinionated and have nothing to say?) 
Maybe this is less 3D than I could have experimented with, but it felt comforting to just open indesign and mess around

The concept and title is based from a book by Dr. Bessel van der Kolk, a psychologist who is one of the leading pioneers and specialists of trauma psychology and research.

*I'm forced to live a meaningless and unreasonable tragedy
Who the hell said ‚Äúafter rain comes fair weather‚Äù
I can't imagine this bad dream ending*

The mask is referencing a Hannya mask that's used in Noh theater, which is used in the performances to depict female demons that are filled with jealousy. The traditional mask, depending on the angle it is viewed, can show either a demonic or tortured expression. I've also been intrigued by the themes in Japanese horror stories, which often focus on building the suspense, and the duality of tragedy and anger in vengeful spirits.

**Week**: 13

**Title**: Introspection

**Medium**: Keyboard, and some words.

**Description**: The first thing I thought of when looking at the title of this week's prompt was introspection. I wanted to explore poetry a bit more so I did some reading on limericks and worked with that structure. So the first one titled *SeemsGood* is about my general high school experience. The second one titled *Mirror, mirror* is about how I used to have a hard time looking at my own reflection. I also recorded myself reading them cause why not? Enjoy!

**Social Media**: twitch.tv/mrgreeyne


*SeemsGood*
I look back and think "god that was tough".
It was just four years, though they were rough.
Grandiose my plans,
Then, well, shit hit the fan.
I stumbled, yet here I stand, proudly scuffed. 


*Mirror, mirror*
They say pictures hold one thousand words.
A reflection? Perhaps two-thirds?
Stupid, sad, ugly,
Pretentious, pudgy?
Giving them value? Now thats absurd.

Week 14
Title: The End of Zeno's Paradox
Medium: Clip Studio Paint
Description:
I've tried, entered, done, a lot of creative endeavors throughout my life, and looking back, it has been quite frustrating, to say the least. This frustration has consumed me over the past several years, and I'm not sure last year was even the peak.

I've sold all my camera gear to help make ends meet, threw away my collection of piano sheet music (much to my older brother's surprise), and I'm not sure where to go from here; I think I've reached my limit, whatever it may be.

I based this on a scene from Takeshi Kitano's 2008 movie "Achilles and the Tortoise," where he based the film plot on the concept of Zeno's paradox in an artistic sense.

**Title:** Cindy Should Pay Me to Moderate
**Medium:** Music/Ableton Live 11 Suite
**Description:**

_(Cindy please play this song first)._

So of course "fire" means "rapping" but Cindy also mentioned "value", "contrast", "bright", "heart", and "too much." So that's what I used to write the bars.

This is the first non-meme rap song I've ever written. I could have gone down the meme route but it's more challenging if I welcome people cringing at my lyrics and rap voice.

_This song will not appear on the refresh album._

**Title:** Coming Up Spades
**Medium:** Music/Ableton Live 11 Suite
**Description:**

**Volume warning.**

To play with expressiveness would be the opposite of playing robotically. Adding the "face" to that means it's also about passion and improvisation. When you add the voice, it's about falsetto, belting, loudness, distortion, mistakes, and roughness.

Lines means melody lines, emphasis is about progression/phrase changes over time. "Look at me" represents the boisterous pride of what is being sung and represented.

Title:  illiteracy
Medium:  chinese calligraphy 
Description: The art philosophy known as "Nanyang Art Style" is a fusion of western and eastern art style. Often, pioneers of this art styles employed western mediums and materials, paired with subject matters of eastern origins / things you commonly see in asia. Some of the pioneering artists are Georgette Chen, Liu Kang etc. 

However, thats not what im doing, im doing a reverse Nanyang Art style, and another art philosophy "Xieyi" (write meaning), where in traditional chinese art is often paired with peotry, yea fuck that, the words is the subject matter and the icon of the respective words are the peotry. 

But, doing this work reminds me, i suck at calligraphy.

Title: Resistance 4 - Sometimes, The Heart Yearns For Mangoes
Medium: Clip Studio Paint

Description: A change of pace, I think? I couldn't really pinpoint any concept to execute for this week, but this imagery had lingered to me for a few days. Then I also remembered a 1994 poem I read from a book whose title for this I based it from.

The poem is about homesickness and wishing for a better world from a faraway place, a faraway country. It kind of reminds me about our own home in the province, where we had a mango tree where we'd sometimes get unripe mangoes for snacks.

The mango is the national fruit of the Philippines, and are usually in season around the hot and dry season (April-May).

Fruit doesn't really make a lot of noise, at least nothing that sounds pleasant. My banana ocarina was not shelf-stable.

But I get what Cindy's trying to do here. The analogue for basics for musicians is, I dunno, first pieces? Drills? Fur Elise? Wonderwall? Well, I learned music production using FL Studio (Fruity Loops) which is a funny coincidence, so I'll use that. Everything I wrote when I was younger (12), I put on Newgrounds Audio Portal. This song may bring back memories for you as it does for me.

Note: Please turn the volume all the way up. Might not be loud enough even then.

Week: 16
Title: what is bigger, a giant bidoof or an individual's life? 
Medium: krita
Description: subject matters of artists like Edward Hopper tends to place equal weight for the furniture and the human matter, for example, the parallelism of the shapes of his human subject and non-human subjects, the compositions as well. Edward Hopper has invoked thought within his audience, how important is life? Are our lives just as unimportant than the furniture we buy? Despite his work is influenced by post war America, it can resonate to his audience even in contemporary times. 

Most people would agree, giant scaly creatures were killed by a  zooming rock, how much of this event lead up to the development of the homo genus, will anyone of us be here? Through death we start a new, just like creativity, starting a fresh might require one to give up everything and start anew. 

Another thing I have realised is that there are always really beautiful scenery most of the time (e.g. sun sets, beautiful cloud formations), however, before, when I was still busy with life, I was never able to enjoy them. Now that I am forced to slow down my pace, I am definitely more appreciative to take about 5 to 10 minutes to look up and look far.

Title: sometimes art is not worth having a mental breakdown over
Medium: FireAlpaca
Description: So... I was late for once. Annnd this wasn't even what I was working on, this is just that same warm up I posted a while back. I probably should've just posted this last week so I could avoid falling into a depression after crumbling under the pressure, but... it wasn't polished, and I didn't want my work on the other piece to go to waste. However... the piece I *was* working on sent me into a depression spiral where I hated working on it and hated myself for the quality slowly deteriorating as I attempted to render a whole painting in just two days. Moral of the story: don't push yourself too hard. And... learn proper time management lol (although school kinda forced my hand... and I overestimated myself haha). I'll go back to the other piece when I'm ready (since I do still want to finish it), but I'll post what I currently have of it in the <#794059396165926913> channel for those who are curious.

Description: The idiom is defined as "an endless, self-defeating, or pointless pursuit...The term is commonly associated with an exhausting, repetitive lifestyle that leaves no time for relaxation or enjoyment."~~(thanks wikipedia)~~ The concept was initially sketched out two years ago, but quickly shelved after major life events and and work affected my ability to put effort into it. I felt like it was the right time to come back and finish it, especially as I'm currently at a point of trying to find a lifestyle that is sustainable yet enjoyable for me as I currently am. Despite how small rat skeletons are in actuality, the piece is the largest I've ever worked with pencil - the drawing itself is around 122cm / 4ft in height.

Title: "Amalgamation: At A Time Like This, Will Someone Be There For You?"
Medium: Digital - Clip Studio Paint

Description: My first attempt at digital painting! Meh results, I think.

I tried to recreate this scenery of the Taal Volcano Island in Tagaytay, a popular tourist destination south of Manila, along a steep access road that we crossed during an official business trip where a teammate and I were doing ocular inspections of venues from the recently-concluded 30th Southeast Asian Games.

At that time, I recently had two breakdowns, and a string of realizations stemming from an office crush. And when I saw the view from our service vehicle, I couldn't help but tear up a little. It was so majestic, and made me realize that I had been so preoccupied with my own self that I've forgotten to "stop and smell the flowers," so to speak. I couldn't be bothered to just... be.

The title is derived from the text displayed on the original Japanese theatrical trailer for Takeshi Kitano's 1997 movie HANA-BI.
