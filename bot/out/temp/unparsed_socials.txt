Week: 4
**Title:  ** Dancing Cloud
Medium: Digital (Clip Studio Paint)
Description: A one minute gesture sketch turned into a monochrome piece where negative space was used to explore values. Internally mad at the anatomy being off but I promised myself to only work from the gesture and not to spend an hour fussing over making the form precise. It was fun erasing to add value though. also this description doesn't really describe the piece at all now does it so um, it's a prancing horse in white over a blue background.

Week 4
Title: Bloody Fields
Medium: Felt pen on paper
Description: I actually struggled with the theme, but this came suddenly one day ago. Killing of farmers is still an issue in the Philippines as they struggle for genuine and lasting land reform. January 22 was also the anniversary of the Mendiola Massacre, where 13 farmers were killed when police dispersed a large farmer's protest. Landlessness and vestiges of feudalism remains to this day.

Week 6: Simple Love
Title: "Amalgamation: Smile and Smile"
Ink on paper, 9x12 inches.

Description: Another week, another rush job lol. I had an initial idea but I dumped it since I couldn't execute it. I made this just now.

Anyway... I tried to recreate the moment I shared with friend and a crush from around 2015. I earlier sent her a message apologizing for "being weird" (not my words) after being scolded by someone for acting weird towards two girls. I sent both of them an apology message, unfriended one of them, but left the other to decide for herself. To my surprise, a week later (this exact moment), she said she wasn't mad at me, and we even embraced in the rain, much to my surprise. I held her shoulders and instinctively said, "We're still friends, right?"

And we've remained friends ever since. Last year, I messaged her, short of spilling my feelings for her, while apologizing for all my awkward moments between me and her. She replied that I shouldn't have to be sorry for it, and even she has had her own realizations.

Recently, she even told me maybe we'd work on a project someday and even referred me to her friend about building a community start up. She's been so kind to me, it actually disarms me.

The title is derived from a piece by Joe Hisaishi for the movie HANA-BI (Fireworks), directed by Takeshi Kitano.

Medium: Digital (Clip Studio Paint)
Socials: @rjmmendoza on IG/Twitter | A1EwanRichards on Twitch

Description: 

It's not a desert in the typical sense. It's an amalgam of sugar cane farms and the concept of "peace of the cemetery," referring to a quote by St. Oscar Romero.

The thoughts I _did_ have about something DesignRefresh were focused around calm, comforting fire providing warmth & a safe haven.
