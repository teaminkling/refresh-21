Decided to contrast this with my last two pieces by using mainly lighter values. And since we're looking at movement, thought I'd try and pump in some more overt narrative stuff too.

Week: 4
**Title:  ** Dancing Cloud
Medium: Digital (Clip Studio Paint)
Description: A one minute gesture sketch turned into a monochrome piece where negative space was used to explore values. Internally mad at the anatomy being off but I promised myself to only work from the gesture and not to spend an hour fussing over making the form precise. It was fun erasing to add value though. also this description doesn't really describe the piece at all now does it so um, it's a prancing horse in white over a blue background.

**Week:** 4
**Title**: MURKE SHADOES
**Medium**: Ableton Live 10
**Description**: "Murky silhouettes" sounds metal and I got my wisdom teeth out so I couldn't really do what I usually do.

"Tone" reminds me of a sick and phat guitar toan that has "value." "Rhythm" obviously means blastbeats and "movement" means the movement of the head up and down as the music flows through your soul and out your butt.

"Monochromatic colour" to me means it shouldn't have any melody and "background colour" is "black" as in "black metal."

January 22 was also the anniversary of the Mendiola Massacre, where 13 farmers were killed when police dispersed a large farmer's protest. Landlessness and vestiges of feudalism remains to this day.

**Week:** 5
**Title:** Big Green Dragon Kingdom
**Description:**

In this technical folk metal piece, I focus on changing textures. The video will explain. This piece is very experimental and not meant for human consumption.

"Royal green" is musical imagery: "cold and hard" sounds like heavy metal and "jade" implies an opulence that cuts through: the kanun and saz instruments.

Title: Seal soapstone carving
Medium: soapstone carving
Description: Although the prompt centres around green jade, I carved a piece of soapstone under the pretense of it as white jade. The design is influenced by a well known chinese poem: Quiet Night Thoughts by LiBai, it describes looking up at the moon and thinking of one’s family at home.
I have lightly inked the carving to contrast the details. I have left the seal face (bottom face that is used to stamp signatures) blank.

Title: "Amalgamation: Smile and Smile"
Ink on paper, 9x12 inches.

Description: Another week, another rush job lol. I had an initial idea but I dumped it since I couldn't execute it. I made this just now.

Anyway... I tried to recreate the moment I shared with friend and a crush from around 2015. I earlier sent her a message apologizing for "being weird" (not my words) after being scolded by someone for acting weird towards two girls. I sent both of them an apology message, unfriended one of them, but left the other to decide for herself. To my surprise, a week later (this exact moment), she said she wasn't mad at me, and we even embraced in the rain, much to my surprise. I held her shoulders and instinctively said, "We're still friends, right?"

And we've remained friends ever since. Last year, I messaged her, short of spilling my feelings for her, while apologizing for all my awkward moments between me and her. She replied that I shouldn't have to be sorry for it, and even she has had her own realizations.

Recently, she even told me maybe we'd work on a project someday and even referred me to her friend about building a community start up. She's been so kind to me, it actually disarms me.

The title is derived from a piece by Joe Hisaishi for the movie HANA-BI (Fireworks), directed by Takeshi Kitano.

Medium: Digital (Clip Studio Paint)
Socials: @rjmmendoza on IG/Twitter | A1EwanRichards on Twitch

Description: 

It's not a desert in the typical sense. It's an amalgam of sugar cane farms and the concept of "peace of the cemetery," referring to a quote by St. Oscar Romero. The title is a rough translation of a poem by Filipino poet Axel Pinpin, originally titled "Kung Puntod na ang Lupa" (literal: If the Land is a Tomb").

Art wise, a bit of a quick and dirty one. (Was starting to run out of time 😅) 
I used the 3D model viewer of Perseverance to get the rover as accurate as possible. And then decided screw it, and just drew over it for sanity's sake (I am not proficient in drawing tech). Wanted to go for something a bit more graphic this week.
Also, drew this while listen to The Martian soundtrack, cause vibes

**Description:**

(Headphones will benefit you for this song).

"Desert" to me means the mixolydian mode (a tonal "pattern"). You know, like The Beatles (Norwegian Wood, I Feel Fine) and a lot of classic rock around that era. "Space" sounds like space emulation: reverb. The theme also influenced the lyrics greatly, which were written before the music.

Oh, and the video? Yeah, I dunno.

Firstly: WHY!!!
Secondly: I would like the record to show that I did in fact completely this piece within the two hours (brainstorming included)

So for this I figured we'd go back to "basics" and hop on board the spoopy train. Since the og pics were from a church, I started thinking along the line of angels, creepy angels... then got inspired by Peter Mohrbacher's angel paintings and ended up with a Dark Souls boss  🤷‍♀️

Regardless, I'm very happy with this one.

Also, the texture from the original picture was used in the hat/disc, the streamers(?) and the ground, and I used the pics of the mosaics for the clothing, in case people were curious 😊

Each piece has it's own title, as well as a color palette of only 10 colors (9 not including black) and *wow* it makes this bright! From top to bottom, left to right, the titles of these pieces are __Red, Blue, Zen, Zap, Sunset, Power, __ and __Skill.__ I tried using symmetry and mood to make these pieces work well beside each other, and I think it really came out well! Not much of a story behind this one, but you may interpret it however you like. Fun week!

Title: Judgement
Desc: When I thought of what to draw for this theme I thought cyberpunk and cool flashing lights.
I realized I wasn't that good at the subject yet and would need time to develop it so instead I went to my mor comfortable style.

This piece represents an innocent girl who never did anything wrong until she made a single mistake.
After the mistake she was banished from heaven and sent to hell to be tormented. It resembles how people expect so much from their role models or normal people in general and even after the smallest mistake leads to people disliking even hating that person.

Small details: She is faceless to represent many different people not just one girl

The hands are people from hell (the misunderstood) people

She is being dropped from heaven without wings to signify she is living and or heaven removed her wings so she isn't able to fly out of the torment

**Description:**

This song features the feeling of oppressive clouds and weather, harsh harmonies and clashing timbres.

This song isn't "soft" but I wrote it by surrealist writing about the sea, the land, and the sky. I wrote back then: "The concept [is] a man on an island panicking and struggling to survive against the weather and wildlife. He makes it on further and further, surprising even himself. Whether or not he survives is answered by the punctuated and sudden conclusion of the last beat."

(This is an old song of mine. Proper submission next week since this week has been hectic. This song will not appear on the Design Refresh album.)

Week 14
Title: Fiery heart
Medium: Charcoal & Watercolour on 110gsm Dollar-store Paper
Description: 

With fire on my mind, I thought of Calcifer and how Howl ate the shooting star! (Howl's Moving Castle 2005)

Timelapse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-7cvM7f3Ps

This was my first endeavor with watercolour and wanted to give it a red hot go (haha) I used a charcoal pencil to free hand the foundation which took me approximately 1 hour to accomplish. I followed with the watercolours spending mixed amounts of my time trying to mix what I wanted and painting in sections at a time, taking a further 4 hours to accomplish.

I like to imagine what shootings off around Howl is the fire from the star, casting amazing light and shadows. I found this quite fun to bring to life! 

Howl, the boy who ate a star. Spicy fire spirit 🔥

**Description:**

_(Cindy please play this song first)._

So of course "fire" means "rapping" but Cindy also mentioned "value", "contrast", "bright", "heart", and "too much." So that's what I used to write the bars.

This is the first non-meme rap song I've ever written. I could have gone down the meme route but it's more challenging if I welcome people cringing at my lyrics and rap voice.

_This song will not appear on the refresh album._

**Volume warning.**

To play with expressiveness would be the opposite of playing robotically. Adding the "face" to that means it's also about passion and improvisation. When you add the voice, it's about falsetto, belting, loudness, distortion, mistakes, and roughness.

Lines means melody lines, emphasis is about progression/phrase changes over time. "Look at me" represents the boisterous pride of what is being sung and represented.

Didn't have time to do something for week 14, but this happened to line up with having flames, so why not! The thoughts I _did_ have about something DesignRefresh were focused around calm, comforting fire providing warmth & a safe haven.

Again, I actually learned a technique on youtube on how to do this, and I think it works out really well for my style! This is dragon Backey (I know they're also cowboys, please don't ask how many alternate universes we have) attacking a rowdy dragon who got too aggro with Prince Astro! He has the powers of fire and Astro has the powers of poison! Both would be painful...

Fruit doesn't really make a lot of noise, at least nothing that sounds pleasant. My banana ocarina was not shelf-stable.

But I get what Cindy's trying to do here. The analogue for basics for musicians is, I dunno, first pieces? Drills? Fur Elise? Wonderwall? Well, I learned music production using FL Studio (Fruity Loops) which is a funny coincidence, so I'll use that. Everything I wrote when I was younger (12), I put on Newgrounds Audio Portal. This song may bring back memories for you as it does for me.

Note: Please turn the volume all the way up. Might not be loud enough even then.

Title: __The ~~Diving~~ Maternal Legendary__
Description: (a small TW for alcohol and drug abuse) I decided to draw not my most favorite pokemon for this week, but the pokemon I *respect* the most. Lugia's past is quite depressing. The creator of Lugia, Takeshi Shudo, heavily relied on alcohol, pills and even *tranquilizers* to get his mind in the workspace, which sadly isn't an uncommon practice with creators. Lugia was supposedly supposed to only show up in Pokemon: The Movie, but it found it's way in the game. She was supposed to represent *life* and maternity. She was supposed to be the Goddess of the Sea, mother of life. Buuut, sadly the details were taken out of Shudo's grasp, and Lugia became a genderless legendary. They even made her a psychic type because, quote "We wanted to make it more powerful."
It's disappointing and disheartening to see what happened to this deep-ocean beauty. The bastardizing of Shudo's ideas caused him to fall into a great despair, where he overdosed a few years later. I never knew Lugia's story before, but now that I do, she is the only legendary I look at and *feel* something. I hope it's the same for you too. She's truly the mother of all glory hidden in Pokemon's lore.

I've really enjoyed this challenge and trying all these new mediums, even when I felt like my brain might explode. Also feel free to quickly flip thru this during the showcase, but would love if the artist note at the end could be read - it's a bit sentimental but just wanted to say a small word of appreciation to everyone (book may take a bit to load all the pages, so a warning in advance).

It was only a few month ago that a picked up my first drawing tablet and started digital art (I was so scared to even use colors 🤣 ). I can comfortably say that every single one of u inspired me and motivated me to try new things till this very day. Big thanks too @Pumpkan for being the best co-host ever in history ❤️  Let’s also take this moment to give a huge thanks to Cindy for making all this happen and creating one of the best art community on twitch. You’ve being a great mentor to me for these past months and I would have never improved this much if it wasn’t for you ❤️ This little subdrake will be supporting ur twitch in the shadows till the next design-refresh <:OOOdrake:779990710639394858> . I don’t know everyone personally but I just want to say I love all of you and I really hope you all keep drawing cause they is just so much more stories to tell and to draw ❤️

A big up to vectorong and cindry for the zine inspiration, though mine looks more like a "calen-zine" than a book-type zine, but whatever. I'm going to have it printed, anyway.

Thank you for everything. Love you all. 🥰
