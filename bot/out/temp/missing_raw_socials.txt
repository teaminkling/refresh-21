=======================================================================================================================

**Week:** 5
**Title:** Big Green Dragon Kingdom
**Description:**

In this technical folk metal piece, I focus on changing textures. The video will explain. This piece is very experimental and not meant for human consumption.

"Royal green" is musical imagery: "cold and hard" sounds like heavy metal and "jade" implies an opulence that cuts through: the kanun and saz instruments.

Art wise, a bit of a quick and dirty one. (Was starting to run out of time üòÖ) 
I used the 3D model viewer of Perseverance to get the rover as accurate as possible. And then decided screw it, and just drew over it for sanity's sake (I am not proficient in drawing tech). Wanted to go for something a bit more graphic this week.

I applied the photo texture to the maccha cup, the rice bowl, and the ground tuna.  I drew in gel pen white on the cup and bowl surfaces to simulate ceramic gloss.  Light reflections can come from any angle on a glossy surface, I made decisions on what parts of the artwork were to be covered up.  Decisions were made (mistakes were made ^^).

**Title:  The Herald**
Medium: Sketchbook Pro
Description: TWO HOURS! *incoherent eldritch screeching*
Firstly: WHY!!!
Secondly: I would like the record to show that I did in fact completely this piece within the two hours (brainstorming included)

So for this I figured we'd go back to "basics" and hop on board the spoopy train. Since the og pics were from a church, I started thinking along the line of angels, creepy angels... then got inspired by Peter Mohrbacher's angel paintings and ended up with a Dark Souls boss  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Regardless, I'm very happy with this one.

Also, the texture from the original picture was used in the hat/disc, the streamers(?) and the ground, and I used the pics of the mosaics for the clothing, in case people were curious üòä

Each piece has it's own title, as well as a color palette of only 10 colors (9 not including black) and *wow* it makes this bright! From top to bottom, left to right, the titles of these pieces are __Red, Blue, Zen, Zap, Sunset, Power, __ and __Skill.__ I tried using symmetry and mood to make these pieces work well beside each other, and I think it really came out well! Not much of a story behind this one, but you may interpret it however you like. Fun week!

ENTRY 60
=======================================================================================================================

Week 9
Medium: phone
Title: Judgement
Desc: When I thought of what to draw for this theme I thought cyberpunk and cool flashing lights.
I realized I wasn't that good at the subject yet and would need time to develop it so instead I went to my mor comfortable style.

This piece represents an innocent girl who never did anything wrong until she made a single mistake.
After the mistake she was banished from heaven and sent to hell to be tormented. It resembles how people expect so much from their role models or normal people in general and even after the smallest mistake leads to people disliking even hating that person.

Small details: She is faceless to represent many different people not just one girl

The hands are people from hell (the misunderstood) people

She is being dropped from heaven without wings to signify she is living and or heaven removed her wings so she isn't able to fly out of the torment

Medium: Charcoal & Watercolour on 110gsm Dollar-store Paper
Description: 

With fire on my mind, I thought of Calcifer and how Howl ate the shooting star! (Howl's Moving Castle 2005)

Timelapse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-7cvM7f3Ps

This was my first endeavor with watercolour and wanted to give it a red hot go (haha) I used a charcoal pencil to free hand the foundation which took me approximately 1 hour to accomplish. I followed with the watercolours spending mixed amounts of my time trying to mix what I wanted and painting in sections at a time, taking a further 4 hours to accomplish.

I like to imagine what shootings off around Howl is the fire from the star, casting amazing light and shadows. I found this quite fun to bring to life! 

Howl, the boy who ate a star. Spicy fire spirit üî•

_(Cindy please play this song first)._

So of course "fire" means "rapping" but Cindy also mentioned "value", "contrast", "bright", "heart", and "too much." So that's what I used to write the bars.

This is the first non-meme rap song I've ever written. I could have gone down the meme route but it's more challenging if I welcome people cringing at my lyrics and rap voice.

_This song will not appear on the refresh album._

**Title:** Coming Up Spades
**Medium:** Music/Ableton Live 11 Suite
**Description:**

**Volume warning.**

To play with expressiveness would be the opposite of playing robotically. Adding the "face" to that means it's also about passion and improvisation. When you add the voice, it's about falsetto, belting, loudness, distortion, mistakes, and roughness.

Lines means melody lines, emphasis is about progression/phrase changes over time. "Look at me" represents the boisterous pride of what is being sung and represented.

Medium: Paint Tool SAI
Title: __The ~~Diving~~ Maternal Legendary__
Description: (a small TW for alcohol and drug abuse) I decided to draw not my most favorite pokemon for this week, but the pokemon I *respect* the most. Lugia's past is quite depressing. The creator of Lugia, Takeshi Shudo, heavily relied on alcohol, pills and even *tranquilizers* to get his mind in the workspace, which sadly isn't an uncommon practice with creators. Lugia was supposedly supposed to only show up in Pokemon: The Movie, but it found it's way in the game. She was supposed to represent *life* and maternity. She was supposed to be the Goddess of the Sea, mother of life. Buuut, sadly the details were taken out of Shudo's grasp, and Lugia became a genderless legendary. They even made her a psychic type because, quote "We wanted to make it more powerful."
It's disappointing and disheartening to see what happened to this deep-ocean beauty. The bastardizing of Shudo's ideas caused him to fall into a great despair, where he overdosed a few years later. I never knew Lugia's story before, but now that I do, she is the only legendary I look at and *feel* something. I hope it's the same for you too. She's truly the mother of all glory hidden in Pokemon's lore.

Also feel free to quickly flip thru this during the showcase, but would love if the artist note at the end could be read - it's a bit sentimental but just wanted to say a small word of appreciation to everyone (book may take a bit to load all the pages, so a warning in advance).

Nothing fancy for the last week of the design refresh 2021 as I want to take this time to praise all the wonderful artists that submitted their art. It was only a few month ago that a picked up my first drawing tablet and started digital art (I was so scared to even use colors ü§£ ). I can comfortably say that every single one of u inspired me and motivated me to try new things till this very day. Big thanks too @Pumpkan for being the best co-host ever in history ‚ù§Ô∏è  Let‚Äôs also take this moment to give a huge thanks to Cindy for making all this happen and creating one of the best art community on twitch. You‚Äôve being a great mentor to me for these past months and I would have never improved this much if it wasn‚Äôt for you ‚ù§Ô∏è This little subdrake will be supporting ur twitch in the shadows till the next design-refresh  .

Week: 17

Title: So this week I am not submitting anything really, but I did draw something based on the prompt (attached image is more proof than anything else). I've been thinking about who one should make art for, the role of the audience, and so on. It made me feel weird. What do I draw that is only for me? What does good/bad/finished/unfinished mean? There are of course many contradictions in this, but let's ignore them!

Description: I chose to base this week's drawing on a1ewanrichards's work. The subjects, the markers, the honesty of the strokes really amazes me.

**Week:** 17
**Title:** _Lonely Light_
**Medium:** Ableton Live 11 Studio

Submission 3/5.

**Preamble:**

I planned to do a colossal anthology of pieces, week after week, each with different artists to create a storyline and a concept EP _in addition_ to the five pieces of work I actually did for the final week of the refresh. The planning document I have for that clocks in at just under 2,000 words, uses art from 16 artists, and is a coming-of-age story about an immortal wizard. Nobody wants to hear that.

In either case, I'd need to take leave to have enough time to write that much music. Anyway:

**Description:**

INSP: https://refresh21.fiveclawd.com/blog/trixynetex-week-7-f8df/

When @TrixyNetex submitted SOL 0 in Week 7, I remarked how similar it was to official modern NASA concept art for space tourism. I've always been fascinated with the idea of personification of robots for music and art, so I wrote a song around that idea.

Also, I don't like making excuses for my singing but I underwent major dental surgery before singing. Probably shouldn't be singing, but it's already done so...

Week 17:
Title: Inspiration 
Medium: Toon Boom Harmony

Description: I am late but still on time for the showcase   Thanks to all the deadline extensions I was still able to make the morphing gif idea I had for this!
Because I haven't been able to draw anything dedicated for Designrefresh at all I decided to do all of them at once on the final week. So I came up with the idea to pick a drawing from every designrefresh to represent each week  with that I created morphing gif animation to make each drawing connected to each other and also as a symbol that all the submissions and the art from the community is what truly forms ''Designrefresh''. The color palettes are very limited and I tried re-using the same colors as much as possible. This gif is like my way of making a throwback to every week, it feels like I still got to participate in the whole designrefresh despite only making a dedicated submission on the final week  

Thank you for listening to my ted talk
Cindry thank you for hosting all these design refreshes! I wish I could have participated more but it was already nice to do this ‚ù§Ô∏è

Submission 5/5.

I took a work from every week (without repeats of artists) and wrote 30 second shorts for each one. Most of these shorts are from work that I wrote in the past that has not seen the light of day.

Video features visual work by @jorchael_p, @Scimister, @DoughYeast, @fonz, @cindry, @TheLagExpert , @Goblet, @soleilboo , @arancil, @TITAN011, @paintsepsi, @vectorong, @Pumpkan, @Piacine , @eggyolk, and @a1ewanrichards.

Sorry for leaving people out, but there are only 17 weeks and I went for easiest to match to audio as my main selective metric.

That's it from me. Thanks for listening!

I utilised my own Mandrake model from Week 7 (https://refresh21.fiveclawd.com/blog/winsome-week-7-16e6/). I tried to capture a video of it to replicate the glitter of the original gif, but it didn't look very good. Really enjoyed participating in design refresh. Thanks everyone!
