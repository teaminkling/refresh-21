Week: 5
Title: 
Medium: A3 watercolor, some fine liners, autumn gold ink, a color pencil from a dusty box
Description: On her birthday stream, cindy's birthday wishes were "read chainsaw man" (lol no you read it) and "draw a dragon". So here's the dragon. Couple weeks late, but still.

This week was rough. Probably gonna come back to the sketch and redo this at some point, because I _really_ like the concept itself. Scales are worked over with multiple greens + autumn gold ink.

Week: 14
Title: 
Medium: Watercolor
Description: Still very much a work in progress, but posting what's currently on paper. Friend asked if I could make something for his wall, so I sat down and improvised some stuff, did a refined version, then an A3 sketch, now lightboxing it up to watercolor. Didn't have time to do something for week 14, but this happened to line up with having flames, so why not! The thoughts I _did_ have about something DesignRefresh were focused around calm, comforting fire providing warmth & a safe haven. 

Forest w/ blue flame wisps, foxes & birbs rorodoAAA congregating around a big owl statue. Lore yet to be determined.

Title: 
Medium: Fineliner 0.05 mm yay
Description: Not cleaning my submission up today ;_; seriously sorry please make do

It's treefolk migration season, and for woodland folk daring to climb them it's prime time to gather food from up there. 

Guys, guys, just sitting down putting in lines here and there where you feel like it is so much fun. Birds around the treefolk for scale.
