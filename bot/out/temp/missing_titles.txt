Week: 3
Title: A Shining Star
Medium: FireAlpaca
Description: Sooo, week 3, huh? Due to school and my personal life, this came out rather rushed... However, I still like the character design I came up with! The background was inspired by a certain rhythm game, kudos to you if you know the one I'm talking about ;p

Week: 4
**Title:  ** : Stress
Medium: Game
Description: I thought I could finish this within 2 days (including learning + execution), ended up having to scrap a lot of the ideas due to my lack of knowledge and sleep deprivation. (definitely not my proudest project, bad coding ethics, cutting corners)

**The Search **
Medium: Sketchbook Pro
Description: Murky, silhouette... well, I must oblige! (It's like you want me to draw spoopy shit) üòõ
Decided to contrast this with my last two pieces by using mainly lighter values. And since we're looking at movement, thought I'd try and pump in some more overt narrative stuff too.
Enjoy!

Week: 5
Title: 
Medium: A3 watercolor, some fine liners, autumn gold ink, a color pencil from a dusty box
Description: On her birthday stream, cindy's birthday wishes were "read chainsaw man" (lol no you read it) and "draw a dragon". So here's the dragon. Couple weeks late, but still.

This week was rough. Probably gonna come back to the sketch and redo this at some point, because I _really_ like the concept itself. Scales are worked over with multiple greens + autumn gold ink.

**Spicy Tuna  **
Medium:  Traditional art.  Copic markers and pens, gell pen.
Description:  A delicious Japanese meal for lunch - a bowl of spicy tuna and rice with chopped onion garnish, along with a cup of maccha.  
I applied the photo texture to the maccha cup, the rice bowl, and the ground tuna.  I drew in gel pen white on the cup and bowl surfaces to simulate ceramic gloss.  Light reflections can come from any angle on a glossy surface, I made decisions on what parts of the artwork were to be covered up.  Decisions were made (mistakes were made ^^).

Week: 9
Medium: Paint Tool SAI
Title: __Dragon Collage__
Desc: Wow I'm the first one submitting this week? That's weird. Anyways, I decided for this week to draw a bunch of dragons because I couldn't decide on just one with all the thumbnails I made! Each piece has it's own title, as well as a color palette of only 10 colors (9 not including black) and *wow* it makes this bright! From top to bottom, left to right, the titles of these pieces are __Red, Blue, Zen, Zap, Sunset, Power, __ and __Skill.__ I tried using symmetry and mood to make these pieces work well beside each other, and I think it really came out well! Not much of a story behind this one, but you may interpret it however you like. Fun week!

Title: Exhaustion
Medium: FireAlpaca
Description: Was going to do something cuter this week and make a lovecore aesthetic piece, buuuut I've just been,, so tired lately. Mom's been keeping me up until 2 am all week for `reasons` so I haven't been getting more than 5 hours of sleep per day... so I decided to convey that through handwritten lettering. I like the ghostly vibe that I stumbled onto. Don't worry btw, I'll rest up... take this simple piece cuz I'm stubborn and want to participate in every week lol

Week: 14
Title: 
Medium: Watercolor
Description: Still very much a work in progress, but posting what's currently on paper. Friend asked if I could make something for his wall, so I sat down and improvised some stuff, did a refined version, then an A3 sketch, now lightboxing it up to watercolor. Didn't have time to do something for week 14, but this happened to line up with having flames, so why not! The thoughts I _did_ have about something DesignRefresh were focused around calm, comforting fire providing warmth & a safe haven. 

Forest w/ blue flame wisps, foxes & birbs rorodoAAA congregating around a big owl statue. Lore yet to be determined.

Week: 15
Title: Resistance 4 - Sometimes, The Heart Yearns For Mangoes
Medium: Clip Studio Paint

Description: A change of pace, I think? I couldn't really pinpoint any concept to execute for this week, but this imagery had lingered to me for a few days. Then I also remembered a 1994 poem I read from a book whose title for this I based it from.

The poem is about homesickness and wishing for a better world from a faraway place, a faraway country. It kind of reminds me about our own home in the province, where we had a mango tree where we'd sometimes get unripe mangoes for snacks.

The mango is the national fruit of the Philippines, and are usually in season around the hot and dry season (April-May).

Week: 15
Title: sometimes art is not worth having a mental breakdown over
Medium: FireAlpaca
Description: So... I was late for once. Annnd this wasn't even what I was working on, this is just that same warm up I posted a while back. I probably should've just posted this last week so I could avoid falling into a depression after crumbling under the pressure, but... it wasn't polished, and I didn't want my work on the other piece to go to waste. However... the piece I *was* working on sent me into a depression spiral where I hated working on it and hated myself for the quality slowly deteriorating as I attempted to render a whole painting in just two days. Moral of the story: don't push yourself too hard. And... learn proper time management lol (although school kinda forced my hand... and I overestimated myself haha). I'll go back to the other piece when I'm ready (since I do still want to finish it), but I'll post what I currently have of it in the <#794059396165926913> channel for those who are curious.

**Title:  Ozymandias**
Medium: Clip studio paint 
Description: So this is an idea have had since week 7, but I didn't have the time to pull it off and also had too many ideas for that week. However I honestly think it fits with this week's theme better üòõ
So this is based off the poem "Ozymandias" by Percy Bysshe Shelley. Good poem, go read it. This is also my first real go with Clip studio and trying to make a webtoon/uploading a webtoon.
So yeah, go read it üòò
(Don't worry, it's short)

Description: Not cleaning my submission up today ;_; seriously sorry please make do

It's treefolk migration season, and for woodland folk daring to climb them it's prime time to gather food from up there. 

Guys, guys, just sitting down putting in lines here and there where you feel like it is so much fun. Birds around the treefolk for scale.
