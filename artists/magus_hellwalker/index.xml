This art was lovingly created using: Digital 3D (Blender).
Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Not my model. I tried to model a dragon in 3D but I&amp;rsquo;m not good at sculpting, but the shading of the model, lighting and environment are my work. Added 4 pin lights to get the translucent jade effect inside the model.

This art was lovingly created using: 3D Digital.
Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes I was playing around with some atmospheric lighting in Blender and started playing with some circles and then this happened. Kind of weird but I like it the result.

Week 2: Deep Ocean. This art was lovingly created using: 3D Digital.
Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Using Blender 3D I created the Greek temple about 6 years ago and always had a vision about creating an underwater scene. Today I accomplished something that resembles an underwater Greek Temple or could it be the edge of Atlantis?</description></item><item><title>It Spins</title><link>https://refresh21.fiveclawd.com/blog/magus_hellwalker-week-1-d71e/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh21.fiveclawd.com/blog/magus_hellwalker-week-1-d71e/</guid><description> The above is an MP4 video link.
