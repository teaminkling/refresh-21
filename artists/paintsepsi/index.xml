Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Since I had more time than I initially thought, I decided to add a little more to the piece! I don&amp;rsquo;t think I need to say more than I initially wrote in the original piece but I hope you enjoy the Directors Extended Cut of the piece haha

This art was lovingly created using: Photoshop.
Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes I wanted to do a non paint style for this one and was hugely hugely inspired by elliotisacoolguy on twitch and made something in his style. The title comes from this great The 1975 song, recc you all listen to it!. I made a few options just to make it a bit more interesting</description></item><item><title>Irene</title><link>https://refresh21.fiveclawd.com/blog/paintsepsi-week-5-79ae/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh21.fiveclawd.com/blog/paintsepsi-week-5-79ae/</guid><description>Week 5: Royal Green. This art was lovingly created using: Procreate.
Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes It’s a quick piece I drew based on Irene from Red Velvet! I tried to make her look kind of like a jade statue but the reflections and lighting I don’t quite understand yet&amp;hellip; time for some studies

This art was lovingly created using: Procreate.
Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes SO, I started a concept on stream, I wasn’t happy with it, and then continued working on it until it became completely different (other than being P5 related). So now I’m here, 4 hours later, with a different piece. I love the use of silhouettes in P5 and it just clicked with me to do something related to it for this submission!</description></item><item><title>Untitled</title><link>https://refresh21.fiveclawd.com/blog/paintsepsi-week-3-911a/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh21.fiveclawd.com/blog/paintsepsi-week-3-911a/</guid><description>Week 3: Red Circle. This art was lovingly created using: Procreate.
Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Simple profile draw based on Akihiko Yoshida’s art. Was trying to do a new rendering style with the hair and am not quite happy with it yet, but it’s getting there!

This art was lovingly created using: Procreate.
Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Since we were talking about Dragons in a previous stream I felt like drawing one&amp;hellip; like a sea dragon, those exist right? I rarely draw things like this so I’m a little shy to submit this one, but we’re all learning right?

This art was lovingly created using: Procreate Digital Painting.
Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Basically a portrait of a model but using the Pantone colour of the year as the background. I thought the brightness of the yellow really stood out and so I ended up really appreciating the way it turned out!
