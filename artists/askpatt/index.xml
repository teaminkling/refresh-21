This art was lovingly created using: PS.
Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Desc: Silhouette using negative space and texture to bring forward the figure and clothing. For movement, I went more subtle with hair flow that cuts through the face rather than drawn in. Note: save your work&amp;hellip;i lost the first draft and finished this 1 hr before deadline
