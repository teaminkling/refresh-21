This art was lovingly created using: soapstone carving.
Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Although the prompt centres around green jade, I carved a piece of soapstone under the pretense of it as white jade. The design is influenced by a well known chinese poem: Quiet Night Thoughts by LiBai, it describes looking up at the moon and thinking of oneâ€™s family at home.
I have lightly inked the carving to contrast the details.</description></item></channel></rss>
