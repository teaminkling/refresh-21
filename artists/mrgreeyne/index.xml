Week 13: Look At Me. This art was lovingly created using: Keyboard, and some words..
Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes The first thing I thought of when looking at the title of this week&amp;rsquo;s prompt was introspection. I wanted to explore poetry a bit more so I did some reading on limericks and worked with that structure. So the first one titled SeemsGood* is about my general high school experience.</description></item><item><title>Yesterday</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/mrgreeyne-week-11-ebfe/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/mrgreeyne-week-11-ebfe/</guid><description>Week 11: Atmosphere Spectrum.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes A smattering of haikus for my first (and late ehehe) design refresh. Enjoy!
I mumble and groan
Basking in her warm embrace
Good morning, sunshine
Just as the wind blows,
As the clouds and trees just be,
I think of nothing.
Accompany me
Ebony night, Lake Shore Drive
What&amp;rsquo;s for dinner, beans?
Unfathomable
Magnificent, glorious
Twinkling far away</description></item></channel></rss>
