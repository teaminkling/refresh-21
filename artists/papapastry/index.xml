Week 15: Back to Basics. This art was lovingly created using: Music/Fruity Loops Studio 20.
Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Fruit doesn&amp;rsquo;t really make a lot of noise, at least nothing that sounds pleasant. My banana ocarina was not shelf-stable.
But I get what Cindy&amp;rsquo;s trying to do here. The analogue for basics for musicians is, I dunno, first pieces? Drills? Fur Elise? Wonderwall? Well, I learned music production using FL Studio (Fruity Loops) which is a funny coincidence, so I&amp;rsquo;ll use that.</description></item><item><title>Cindy Should Pay Me to Moderate</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/papapastry-week-14-92c3/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/papapastry-week-14-92c3/</guid><description>Week 14: Absolute Fire. This art was lovingly created using: Music/Ableton Live 11 Suite.
Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes (Cindy please play this song first).
So of course &amp;ldquo;fire&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;rapping&amp;rdquo; but Cindy also mentioned &amp;ldquo;value&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;contrast&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;bright&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;heart&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;too much.&amp;rdquo; So that&amp;rsquo;s what I used to write the bars.
This is the first non-meme rap song I&amp;rsquo;ve ever written. I could have gone down the meme route but it&amp;rsquo;s more challenging if I welcome people cringing at my lyrics and rap voice.</description></item><item><title>Coming Up Spades</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/papapastry-week-13-fc72/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/papapastry-week-13-fc72/</guid><description>View on SoundCloud. Week 13: Look At Me. This art was lovingly created using: Music/Ableton Live 11 Suite.
Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Volume warning.
To play with expressiveness would be the opposite of playing robotically. Adding the &amp;ldquo;face&amp;rdquo; to that means it&amp;rsquo;s also about passion and improvisation. When you add the voice, it&amp;rsquo;s about falsetto, belting, loudness, distortion, mistakes, and roughness.
Lines means melody lines, emphasis is about progression/phrase changes over time. &amp;ldquo;Look at me&amp;rdquo; represents the boisterous pride of what is being sung and represented.</description></item><item><title>Fuck</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/papapastry-week-13-fd44/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/papapastry-week-13-fd44/</guid><description>Week 13: Look At Me.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes lmao haven&amp;rsquo;t drawn since year 9 and i&amp;rsquo;m in my mid twenties now so good time to start over
i drew this in around five minutes
context: woke up at 4pm today and had an hour to write a song. wasn&amp;rsquo;t gonna happen so here&amp;rsquo;s a rerun and some art, and a reason why i shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be allowed near a drawing tablet ever again</description></item><item><title>Noodle Bar</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/papapastry-week-12-972c/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/papapastry-week-12-972c/</guid><description>Week 12: Visual Words. This art was lovingly created using: Music/Ableton Live 11 Suite.
Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes This week&amp;rsquo;s theme has given me completely free rein on what I wanted to write. I fulfilled the theme entirely through the video. It&amp;rsquo;s visual and it&amp;rsquo;s words innit.
I was going to do kinetic typography but I had ten minutes to learn, which I determined to not be enough time. Songwriting process: noodle two chords, sing in a bathroom, noodle some more.</description></item><item><title>The Island</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/papapastry-week-11-eb4c/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/papapastry-week-11-eb4c/</guid><description>View on SoundCloud. Week 11: Atmosphere Spectrum. This art was lovingly created using: Music.
Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes This song features the feeling of oppressive clouds and weather, harsh harmonies and clashing timbres.
This song isn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;soft&amp;rdquo; but I wrote it by surrealist writing about the sea, the land, and the sky. I wrote back then: &amp;ldquo;The concept [is] a man on an island panicking and struggling to survive against the weather and wildlife.</description></item><item><title>Good Clothes</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/papapastry-week-10-9303/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/papapastry-week-10-9303/</guid><description>Week 10: Folds and Folds.

This art was lovingly created using: Audio/Ableton Live 11 Suite.
Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes &amp;ldquo;Bold strokes&amp;rdquo; sounds upbeat, aggressive, complex, and coloured by live instrumentals.
Before the &amp;lsquo;rona there was live music. For those who have not been in a crowd or performed contemporary music, there is nothing like it. Every mistake, every ad lib: the energy is secondary to nothing. It is extremely obvious when watching some of the best bands out there that everybody is having so much fun.</description></item><item><title>One Drug Please</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/papapastry-week-8-0c0e/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/papapastry-week-8-0c0e/</guid><description>Week 8: High Sheen. This art was lovingly created using: Audio/Ableton Live 11 Suite.
Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Alternative title: playing around with Live 11&amp;rsquo;s new cool features.
&amp;ldquo;High Sheen&amp;rdquo; reminds me of a few things. Getting high (on life) in a club, shiny lights from the sun and from stage lights, bright, natural naive feelings. &amp;ldquo;Sheen&amp;rdquo; of youth, so to speak, and stuff I have nearly no experience with at all.</description></item><item><title>Footprints</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/papapastry-week-7-9d88/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/papapastry-week-7-9d88/</guid><description>Week 7: Disturbed Desert. This art was lovingly created using: Ableton Live 10 Suite.
Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4nay640JrxBZhNMiVIYTFg
(Headphones will benefit you for this song).
&amp;ldquo;Desert&amp;rdquo; to me means the mixolydian mode (a tonal &amp;ldquo;pattern&amp;rdquo;). You know, like The Beatles (Norwegian Wood, I Feel Fine) and a lot of classic rock around that era. &amp;ldquo;Space&amp;rdquo; sounds like space emulation: reverb. The theme also influenced the lyrics greatly, which were written before the music.</description></item><item><title>Big Green Dragon Kingdom</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/papapastry-week-5-1d3c/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/papapastry-week-5-1d3c/</guid><description>Week 5: Royal Green. This art was lovingly created using: Music/Ableton Live 10 Suite.
Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes In this technical folk metal piece, I focus on changing textures. The video will explain. This piece is very experimental and not meant for human consumption.
&amp;ldquo;Royal green&amp;rdquo; is musical imagery: &amp;ldquo;cold and hard&amp;rdquo; sounds like heavy metal and &amp;ldquo;jade&amp;rdquo; implies an opulence that cuts through: the kanun and saz instruments.</description></item><item><title>MURKE SHADOES</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/papapastry-week-4-64a1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/papapastry-week-4-64a1/</guid><description>View on SoundCloud. Week 4: Murky Silhouettes. This art was lovingly created using: Ableton Live 10.
Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes &amp;ldquo;Murky silhouettes&amp;rdquo; sounds metal and I got my wisdom teeth out so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t really do what I usually do.
&amp;ldquo;Tone&amp;rdquo; reminds me of a sick and phat guitar toan that has &amp;ldquo;value.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Rhythm&amp;rdquo; obviously means blastbeats and &amp;ldquo;movement&amp;rdquo; means the movement of the head up and down as the music flows through your soul and out your butt.</description></item><item><title>Tamago Tama</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/papapastry-week-3-31f0/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/papapastry-week-3-31f0/</guid><description>View on SoundCloud. View on SoundCloud. Week 3: Red Circle. This art was lovingly created using: Audio (Ableton Live 10).
Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Red circle was Japan for me this week. It should be obvious where I went with that in the recording.
To me &amp;ldquo;garnet red&amp;rdquo; meant a very bold sound that&amp;rsquo;s not lowkey at all. Gems are formed under pressure, which to me means heavy distorted guitars, improvisation, garage drums, intentional but fun mistakes in instrument runs, and a very fast tempo.</description></item><item><title>b̴͆͘e̸̲͌w̵͑͘ả̴̀r̶̾̎ȅ̷̌ ̶̃̎t̸͋̈́h̵̎̇e̴͑͂ ̸͑̇d̶̈́͝ě̵̤e̶͊͘p̵̒̀</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/papapastry-week-2-99c5/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/papapastry-week-2-99c5/</guid><description>View on SoundCloud. Week 2: Deep Ocean. This art was lovingly created using: Audio (Ableton Live 10) and a Fender Stratocaster.
Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Not entirely an aesthetic adherence to the theme but more of a compositional one. A morphing of flowing chords with a watery bongo drum (ocean) moves into a Lydian (scale) section. The main focus of the track was about contrast to adhere to &amp;ldquo;space&amp;rdquo;: the differences between the size of objects in the ocean.</description></item></channel></rss>
