Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Volume warning.
To play with expressiveness would be the opposite of playing robotically. Adding the &amp;ldquo;face&amp;rdquo; to that means it&amp;rsquo;s also about passion and improvisation. When you add the voice, it&amp;rsquo;s about falsetto, belting, loudness, distortion, mistakes, and roughness.
Lines means melody lines, emphasis is about progression/phrase changes over time. &amp;ldquo;Look at me&amp;rdquo; represents the boisterous pride of what is being sung and represented.</description></item><item><title>Look behind you, they're the Captain now</title><link>https://inklingtest.com/blog/jonasw-week-13-2bfa/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://inklingtest.com/blog/jonasw-week-13-2bfa/</guid><description> Week 13: Look At Me.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Super last minute submission, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to miss two weeks in a row! So you know when you have a plan, but then you realise you did not give yourself enough time?

Originally was gonna have like 3 or 4 fake screenshots. But time is a cruel mistress.</description></item><item><title>Fragments of Remembrance</title><link>https://inklingtest.com/blog/suavestrawberry-week-13-0fde/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://inklingtest.com/blog/suavestrawberry-week-13-0fde/</guid><description>View on Webtoons.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes based off true events like 1:50 PM 2/4/2021 my water was too hot to drink so i was dying. i think this has inspired me to do more 4komas tho in the future!!! i really like short fun comics, one of my favourite things to draw&amp;hellip; so i hope you like it too!</description></item><item><title>Introspection</title><link>https://inklingtest.com/blog/mrgreeyne-week-13-9eca/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://inklingtest.com/blog/mrgreeyne-week-13-9eca/</guid><description>Week 13: Look At Me.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes The first thing I thought of when looking at the title of this week&amp;rsquo;s prompt was introspection. I wanted to explore poetry a bit more so I did some reading on limericks and worked with that structure. So the first one titled SeemsGood* is about my general high school experience.</description></item><item><title>i suffer</title><link>https://inklingtest.com/blog/pumpkan-week-13-f4a6/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://inklingtest.com/blog/pumpkan-week-13-f4a6/</guid><description>Week 13: Look At Me.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if I was gonna finish on time, but I managed to get these done! I finished watching a let&amp;rsquo;s play of OMORI recently, and it was wonderful experience&amp;hellip; I felt inspired to draw little battle portraits of my OCs in the game&amp;rsquo;s style! Was gonna draw their real world counterparts, but I&amp;hellip; don&amp;rsquo;t have the time nor energy.</description></item><item><title>Portrait 7: Ruminations</title><link>https://inklingtest.com/blog/a1ewanrichards-week-13-4403/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://inklingtest.com/blog/a1ewanrichards-week-13-4403/</guid><description>Week 13: Look At Me.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Completely dissatisfied with my previous entry, so here&amp;rsquo;s a new one. I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling lonely and isolated lately for so long. I feel that nobody will ever bother to listen or understand me.
