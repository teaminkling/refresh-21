Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes I was late, sad. &amp;lt;:CattoCry:800558786418835477&amp;gt; Buut I got this done tho! I&amp;rsquo;ve always loved whenever I got the change to draw fire and fire effects. Again, I actually learned a technique on youtube on how to do this, and I think it works out really well for my style! This is dragon Backey (I know they&amp;rsquo;re also cowboys, please don&amp;rsquo;t ask how many alternate universes we have) attacking a rowdy dragon who got too aggro with Prince Astro!</description></item><item><title>Burnt Out</title><link>https://inklingtest.com/blog/meplaysgamez-week-14-2f2a/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://inklingtest.com/blog/meplaysgamez-week-14-2f2a/</guid><description> Week 14: Absolute Fire.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes This is about burnout and how hard it is sometimes to recognise it while in haste. Just remember to take your time, recognise to take care of your body. Don&amp;rsquo;t burn yourself, it&amp;rsquo;ll take a while to recover!

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes (Cindy please play this song first).
So of course &amp;ldquo;fire&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;rapping&amp;rdquo; but Cindy also mentioned &amp;ldquo;value&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;contrast&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;bright&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;heart&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;too much.&amp;rdquo; So that&amp;rsquo;s what I used to write the bars.
This is the first non-meme rap song I&amp;rsquo;ve ever written. I could have gone down the meme route but it&amp;rsquo;s more challenging if I welcome people cringing at my lyrics and rap voice.</description></item><item><title>Fiery heart</title><link>https://inklingtest.com/blog/shredarbayn-week-14-1e42/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://inklingtest.com/blog/shredarbayn-week-14-1e42/</guid><description>Week 14: Absolute Fire.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes With fire on my mind, I thought of Calcifer and how Howl ate the shooting star! (Howl&amp;rsquo;s Moving Castle 2005)
Timelapse https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-7cvM7f3Ps
This was my first endeavor with watercolour and wanted to give it a red hot go (haha) I used a charcoal pencil to free hand the foundation which took me approximately 1 hour to accomplish.</description></item><item><title>Flames of Phlegethos</title><link>https://inklingtest.com/blog/trixynetex-week-14-6ff8/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://inklingtest.com/blog/trixynetex-week-14-6ff8/</guid><description>Week 14: Absolute Fire.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Let&amp;rsquo;s draw another one of my D&amp;amp;D characters, because dang it! Why not!? Met Athenaeum; tiefling lore bard/warlock and general wielder of hell fire. So fun fact, when I started digital art about a year ago one of my first pieces was of Ath doing neato flame shit.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes I&amp;rsquo;ve tried, entered, done, a lot of creative endeavors throughout my life, and looking back, it has been quite frustrating, to say the least. This frustration has consumed me over the past several years, and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure last year was even the peak.
I&amp;rsquo;ve sold all my camera gear to help make ends meet, threw away my collection of piano sheet music (much to my older brother&amp;rsquo;s surprise), and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure where to go from here; I think I&amp;rsquo;ve reached my limit, whatever it may be.</description></item><item><title>The Five Virtues</title><link>https://inklingtest.com/blog/vectorong-week-14-de8e/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://inklingtest.com/blog/vectorong-week-14-de8e/</guid><description>Week 14: Absolute Fire.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Illustration based on the Fenghuang, a mythological bird whose body symbolizes the celestial bodies and the five tail feathers representing the five virtues of Confucius. It is said that their appearance signals the coming of a new era.
And what better way to honor my favorite mythological bird than to burn in directly into some wood with fire LOL</description></item><item><title>Untitled</title><link>https://inklingtest.com/blog/arancil-week-14-911a/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://inklingtest.com/blog/arancil-week-14-911a/</guid><description>Week 14: Absolute Fire.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Still very much a work in progress, but posting what&amp;rsquo;s currently on paper. Friend asked if I could make something for his wall, so I sat down and improvised some stuff, did a refined version, then an A3 sketch, now lightboxing it up to watercolor. Didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to do something for week 14, but this happened to line up with having flames, so why not!</description></item><item><title>comfy spot</title><link>https://inklingtest.com/blog/piacine-week-14-e01a/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://inklingtest.com/blog/piacine-week-14-e01a/</guid><description>Week 14: Absolute Fire.
