Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Week: 17
I chose to base this week&amp;rsquo;s drawing on a1ewanrichards&amp;rsquo;s work. The subjects, the markers, the honesty of the strokes really amazes me.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes [REVISED, REUPLOAD] This is my own refresh/summary of my past works, with in-depth elaboration for each work. Each entry is lengthy, so for the sake of the actual showcase, please read the foreword and the Week 17 instead, especially the finale where I wrote something special, hopefully.</description></item><item><title>Keep It Simple</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/cindry-week-17-1b83/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/cindry-week-17-1b83/</guid><description>Direct link to a .pdf file.Direct link to a .pdf file.
Week 17: The 4 R&amp;rsquo;s: Finale. This art was lovingly created using: Publication with InDesign.
Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes I made a zine that is basically a doodling book where I included previous submissions to serve as inspiration. Thought this would be a fun thing that people can print off themselves and keep as a sketch book to fill out as something to do after the project is over.</description></item><item><title>Lonely Light</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/papapastry-week-17-342b/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/papapastry-week-17-342b/</guid><description>View on SoundCloud.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Preamble:
I planned to do a colossal anthology of pieces, week after week, each with different artists to create a storyline and a concept EP in addition to the work I actually did for the final week of the refresh. The planning document I have for that clocks in at just under 2,000 words, uses art from 16 artists, and is a coming-of-age story about an immortal wizard.</description></item><item><title>MUSE</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/soleilboo-week-17-7c5e/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/soleilboo-week-17-7c5e/</guid><description>Week 17: The 4 R&amp;rsquo;s: Finale.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes So this is it! This is finale of 17 weeks of Designrefesh! I participated in this awesome community since week 5 and havenâ€™t dropped a single prompt! Iâ€™m proud of myself for this commitment. Thank you @cindry for hosting and everyone who helping and participating! You all inspired me to stick to this all along.</description></item><item><title>Peace is Dynamism</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/pumpkan-week-17-3356/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/pumpkan-week-17-3356/</guid><description>Week 17: The 4 R&amp;rsquo;s: Finale. This art was lovingly created using: Digital, Procreate.
Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes I took inspiration from @a1ewanrichards &amp;ldquo;When the land becomes graveyards&amp;rdquo; (https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/a1ewanrichards-week-7-d4f0/) I loved this piece because it tapped into a vivid memory of playing soccer opposite sugarcane fields, watching them slowly disintegrate into flames and having the ash gently fall on us as we practiced. Life felt like it was so vividly coloured back then.</description></item><item><title>Re:dux</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/paintsepsi-week-17-093b/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/paintsepsi-week-17-093b/</guid><description>Week 17: The 4 R&amp;rsquo;s: Finale.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Since I had more time than I initially thought, I decided to add a little more to the piece! I don&amp;rsquo;t think I need to say more than I initially wrote in the original piece but I hope you enjoy the Directors Extended Cut of the piece haha

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Waaaa, week 17,,, it&amp;rsquo;s here,, and I actually come with a piece of quality (thanks to the extensions lmao). This piece was inspired by @Linalifox&amp;rsquo;s submission for week 4, titled &amp;ldquo;Blue&amp;rdquo;. Their piece reminded me of mermaids, which reminded me of The Little Mermaid and my merman AU that I have for Backey,,, so I drew him and took the pose from the &amp;ldquo;Part of Your World&amp;rdquo; scene in The Little Mermaid.</description></item><item><title>End of a Chapter</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/titan011-week-17-3f12/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/titan011-week-17-3f12/</guid><description>Week 17: The 4 R&amp;rsquo;s: Finale.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Nothing fancy for the last week of the design refresh 2021 as I want to take this time to praise all the wonderful artists that submitted their art. It was only a few month ago that a picked up my first drawing tablet and started digital art (I was so scared to even use colors ðŸ¤£ ).</description></item><item><title>#2021DesignRefresh Portfolio</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/vectorong-week-17-85ff/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/vectorong-week-17-85ff/</guid><description>The image above leads to an external website.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes I find it&amp;rsquo;s always nice to look back whenever you complete a series / project and celebrate, so this is my way of doing so - creating a book with all the pieces I&amp;rsquo;ve submitted. I&amp;rsquo;ve really enjoyed this challenge and trying all these new mediums, even when I felt like my brain might explode.</description></item><item><title>Re:create</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/paintsepsi-week-17-ac8e/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/paintsepsi-week-17-ac8e/</guid><description>Week 17: The 4 R&amp;rsquo;s: Finale.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes wowwww, another side profile of an anime girl, how creative of me&amp;hellip;. I tried to incorporate some of my previous works in this piece&amp;hellip; Week 1 - with the yellow background, Week 3 - Red Circle with the red earrings, Week 4 - Murky silhouette with the persona style art, Week 8 - high sheen from jimmy neutron, Week 9 - the devil girl that I drew, Week 10 - Folds and folds and the anime style.</description></item><item><title>things you use to look at yourself with (the musical/remix)</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/papapastry-week-17-a37a/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/papapastry-week-17-a37a/</guid><description>Week 17: The 4 R&amp;rsquo;s: Finale.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist. More stuff after this one. Thanks to @jumpingbeans for the script and visuals.
I used a guitar with a steel slide, a special piano that uses one string per key (originally created by David Klavins), and Balinese Gamelan instruments.
