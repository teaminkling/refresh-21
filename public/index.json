Cindy is a professional clown, freelance graphic designer, and Twitch streamer.\nThe 2021 Design Refresh is a community centered weekly art challenge. It ran online from January to May and was organised by Cindy Xu. This website hosts the themes and showcases all the entries from the #2021DesignRefresh.\nSite Updates The site is updated automatically on changes to the individual blog pages in around 5 to 10 minutes after the change is made. The blog pages, however, are parsed from Discord. This happens about once a day.\nEvery time a change is made, we review the metafile changes to see what has changed. It is incredibly easy to see if somebody is trying to troll the system so just be careful with what content is uploaded please.\nIf you would like a change on next site update in 24 to 48 hours, then just edit the Discord post you initially posted. Otherwise, you can directly use the \u0026ldquo;suggest an edit\u0026rdquo; link on any page or contact the developer (papapastry#8888) directly to have problems fixed faster.\nFor Nerds This site was written and deployed by me. Ya boi. Thomas \u0026ldquo;papapastry\u0026rdquo; Wang.\nIt uses a three-stage Python pipeline to create Markdown files, and uses the Go programming language with the Hugo static site generator (SSG) to process and create blog posts representing submissions.\nThe stages are:\n Extract from Discord all submissions. Use a complex algorithm to parse submissions into a structured format.  This part also does thumbnail generation which is required because these artists don\u0026rsquo;t know the meaning of the word \u0026ldquo;restraint\u0026rdquo; when they send in 99 MB submissions. Just kidding. Not going to butcher art, but the list views need to be faster for viewers, especially on mobile.   Format the parsed output into blog posts.  The benefit of SSGs is that hosting more than 1.5 gigabytes of files on a server is very expensive and slow. SSGs don\u0026rsquo;t require application servers at all, meaning you\u0026rsquo;re essentially just getting raw files. It\u0026rsquo;s kinda magical: the search feature, for example, works by processing all possible data, indexing it on each build before a user performs a search. No external HTTP calls are made.\nStonks.\nSite\u0026rsquo;s Fucked Ah shit.\nThere are edge cases when dealing with unstructured user data. There are cases that fell through the cracks. If you find any of these, feel free to raise a bug ticket.\nYou can see upcoming features and bug fixes in GitHub Issues, if you\u0026rsquo;re interested.\n","ref":"/about/"},{"title":"Dynames","date":"","description":"by meplaysgamez for week 16: Scaling Giants.

Lugia\u0026rsquo;s past is quite depressing. The creator of Lugia, Takeshi Shudo, heavily relied on alcohol, pills and even *tranquilizers* to get his mind in the workspace, which sadly isn\u0026rsquo;t an uncommon practice with creators. Lugia was supposedly supposed to only show up in Pokemon: The Movie, but it found it\u0026rsquo;s way in the game. She was supposed to represent *life and maternity. She was supposed to be the Goddess of the Sea, mother of life. Buuut, sadly the details were taken out of Shudo\u0026rsquo;s grasp, and Lugia became a genderless legendary. They even made her a psychic type because, quote \u0026ldquo;We wanted to make it more powerful.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s disappointing and disheartening to see what happened to this deep-ocean beauty. The bastardizing of Shudo\u0026rsquo;s ideas caused him to fall into a great despair, where he overdosed a few years later. I never knew Lugia\u0026rsquo;s story before, but now that I do, she is the only legendary I look at and feel something. I hope it\u0026rsquo;s the same for you too.

Combining a typeface (inspired by Quicksand), functionality, and my personal love of multi-use furniture - I bring you the \u0026#34;Comfy\u0026#34; chair. The letters of the word form the wooden frame that allows reclining for use as a chair or a makeshift bed.

Needed green dye to mix into cyan dye and so I made a cactus farm and built a factory around it. uses mostly blocks and stuff you can make from the dyes (also a little stone). Tried to make it look like it pollutes the river (dug out custom rivers and had them flow into the swamp biome for extra dirty effect). Solved the rhythm part by making a noteblock drum-kit in the factory. it\u0026rsquo;s a statement because I was inspired by the Citarum river in Indonesia, most polluted village in the world.

Needed green dye to mix into cyan dye and so I made a cactus farm and built a factory around it. uses mostly blocks and stuff you can make from the dyes (also a little stone). Tried to make it look like it pollutes the river (dug out custom rivers and had them flow into the swamp biome for extra dirty effect).
