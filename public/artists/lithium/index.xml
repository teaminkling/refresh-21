Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Mola mola with a few babies. They&amp;rsquo;re actually way smaller than this in scale but I have to make them visible!

This art was lovingly created using: Clip Studio Paint.
Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes No fruit around and I decided I&amp;rsquo;d go more for the still life angle of the assignment using my succulent pot as a base (yes, it&amp;rsquo;s sparse for now, but it&amp;rsquo;ll have new cuttings soon.)

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Ever had anxiety or panic and heard the word relax? That&amp;rsquo;s a bit of what I tried to capture here. The inner font with harmful/intrusive thoughts I made from my own handwriting and you can download it (linked in next message) and use it if you like.

Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Study of movement and clothing from an incredible performance by Kai during a Freestyle Roulette (link with timestamp cause y&amp;rsquo;all should watch this performance anyway https://youtu.be/XFUyeYrCcN0?t=280) - this moment was so emotive I just felt pulled to paint it in particular. Clothing and hoomans are not my forte.

This art was lovingly created using: Digital (Clip Studio Paint).
Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Really just leaned into the original photograph, only removing the outer rim and clone stamping out some of the edge punctures. Took visual inspiration from the recent NASA/Juno pictures of Jupiter, just played with colors and swirls.

This art was lovingly created using: Digital (Clip Studio Paint).
Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes A blanket, the sound of rain, a chill breeze, and distant thunder&amp;hellip; these were the things I summoned up when I thought about simple joys in my life. This is pretty outside my comfort zone but I like the piece still.

This art was lovingly created using: Digital (Clip Studio Paint).
Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes A one minute gesture sketch turned into a monochrome piece where negative space was used to explore values. Internally mad at the anatomy being off but I promised myself to only work from the gesture and not to spend an hour fussing over making the form precise. It was fun erasing to add value though.</description></item><item><title>Appoh</title><link>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/lithium-week-3-0e2f/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://refresh.fiveclawd.com/blog/lithium-week-3-0e2f/</guid><description>Week 3: Red Circle. This art was lovingly created using: Digital (Clip Studio Paint).
Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Round pony. Red like an apple. And an appaloosa. Tried to focus on character design and form exaggeration since that&amp;rsquo;s an area I want to grow better at.

This art was lovingly created using: Digital (Clip Studio Paint).
Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes Conceptual piece - a look at the depth of the ocean and how far light reaches down below, with a mix of imagining a galaxy of bioluminescent, living starlight. And maybe something larger&amp;hellip;

This art was lovingly created using: Digital (Clip Studio Paint).
Artist&amp;rsquo;s Notes An eight point radial design in the style of a compass rose. Lines are all in the Pantone Yellow, while the background is two shades of blue: classic blue (2020&amp;rsquo;s Pantone color of the year) inside the design and a darker contrasted blue outside of it.
