Week 11: **Atmosphere Spectrum**. This art was lovingly created using: **Paint Tool SAI**.

## Artist's Notes

Getting into dragons again more than I usually do, so I decided to draw some dragon silhouette's against a pretty night sky! I learned an easy trick to making galaxy/night sky patterns awhile back, so I put that to use in the top part of the screen! I like how this came out, even if it's more simple because I've been busy and tired with the new time change.
