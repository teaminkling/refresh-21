Week 6: **Simple Love**. This art was lovingly created using: **Digital (Clip Studio Paint)**.

## Artist's Notes

A blanket, the sound of rain, a chill breeze, and distant thunder... these were the things I summoned up when I thought about simple joys in my life. This is pretty outside my comfort zone but I like the piece still.
