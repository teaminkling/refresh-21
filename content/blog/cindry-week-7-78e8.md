Week 7: **Disturbed Desert**. This art was lovingly created using: **ink on paper,  a comic!**.

## Artist's Notes

I love alliteration lol!
hey isn't is kinda mysterious? I got this idea from when crabs would dig holes at the beach and spit out the water. Finding that in the desert would be super creepy... also stippling is hard. I do really like this though and hope you do too!
