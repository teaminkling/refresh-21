## Artist's Notes

The Shogun of Death is a character ive been working on for a while ( i say working, its an idea in my head). Shoguns are really cool and ive been wanting to draw one so i did. The Shoguns were generals, and the shogun of death leads the army of the dead alongside his opposite, the Shogun of Light (more on that later)
