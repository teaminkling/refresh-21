Week 8: **High Sheen**. This art was lovingly created using: **Paint Tool SAI**.

## Artist's Notes

"Someone had a mighty fine belt-buckle, so I.. borrowed it."
This was a very interesting challenge! Decided to go for a painting-like piece with the belt-buckle being the main focus! If it's hard to see, the texture from the resource is on the belt buckle! I timed myself and I had 7 minutes before the two hour mark!
