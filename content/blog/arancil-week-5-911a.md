Week 5: **Royal Green**. This art was lovingly created using: **A3 watercolor, some fine liners, autumn gold ink, a color pencil from a dusty box**.

## Artist's Notes

On her birthday stream, cindy's birthday wishes were "read chainsaw man" (lol no you read it) and "draw a dragon". So here's the dragon. Couple weeks late, but still.

This week was rough. Probably gonna come back to the sketch and redo this at some point, because I really like the concept itself. Scales are worked over with multiple greens + autumn gold ink.

This week was rough. Probably gonna come back to the sketch and redo this at some point, because I _really_ like the concept itself. Scales are worked over with multiple greens + autumn gold ink.
