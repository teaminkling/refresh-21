Week 6: **Simple Love**. This art was lovingly created using: **Digital, Clip Studio Paint**.

## Artist's Notes

Was meant to be a Week 5 submission but it fits Week 6 for me too. I love my OCs, and it's been great to have them as a creative & emotional outlet! (Also love being able to finish art even if it's not on time LOL)
