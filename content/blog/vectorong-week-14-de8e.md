Week 14: **Absolute Fire**. This art was lovingly created using: **Pyrography (woodburning)**.

## Artist's Notes

Illustration based on the Fenghuang, a mythological bird whose body symbolizes the celestial bodies and the five tail feathers representing the five virtues of Confucius. It is said that their appearance signals the coming of a new era.

And what better way to honor my favorite mythological bird than to burn in directly into some wood with fire LOL
