Week 16: **Scaling Giants**. This art was lovingly created using: **Krita (still mouse)**.

## Artist's Notes

Don't be deceived, the Blue Amazon is a killing machine. Although these robots are programmed to try to act human, they are infact very much controlled by their masters (at least that is what the master thinks). If you think you are in ara ara distance, you are in fact in danger. (didn't manage to finish)
