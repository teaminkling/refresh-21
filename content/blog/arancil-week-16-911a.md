Week 16: **Scaling Giants**. This art was lovingly created using: **Fineliner 0.05 mm yay**.

## Artist's Notes

Not cleaning my submission up today ;_; seriously sorry please make do

It's treefolk migration season, and for woodland folk daring to climb them it's prime time to gather food from up there. 

Guys, guys, just sitting down putting in lines here and there where you feel like it is so much fun. Birds around the treefolk for scale.
