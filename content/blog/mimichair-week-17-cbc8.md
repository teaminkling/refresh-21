Week 17: **The 4 R's: Finale**. This art was lovingly created using: **Toon Boom Harmony**.

## Artist's Notes

I am late but still on time for the showcase   Thanks to all the deadline extensions I was still able to make the morphing gif idea I had for this!

Because I haven't been able to draw anything dedicated for Designrefresh at all I decided to do all of them at once on the final week. So I came up with the idea to pick a drawing from every designrefresh to represent each week  with that I created morphing gif animation to make each drawing connected to each other and also as a symbol that all the submissions and the art from the community is what truly forms ''Designrefresh''. The color palettes are very limited and I tried re-using the same colors as much as possible. This gif is like my way of making a throwback to every week, it feels like I still got to participate in the whole designrefresh despite only making a dedicated submission on the final week  

Thank you for listening to my ted talk

Cindry thank you for hosting all these design refreshes! I wish I could have participated more but it was already nice to do this ❤️
