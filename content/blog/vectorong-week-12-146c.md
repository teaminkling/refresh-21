Week 12: **Visual Words**. This art was lovingly created using: **Ink + Marker, Photoshop**.

## Artist's Notes

Inspired by the range of Italian designer Massimo Vignelli's work, and that "If you can design one thing, you can design everything." Often I feel as a designer and artist, we're directed to only learn a specific "style" of skills, when in reality all your knowledge ends up coming into play in some form. Combining a typeface (inspired by Quicksand), functionality, and my personal love of multi-use furniture - I bring you the "Comfy" chair. The letters of the word form the wooden frame that allows reclining for use as a chair or a makeshift bed.
