Week 17: **The 4 R's: Finale**. This art was lovingly created using: **Publication with InDesign**.

## Artist's Notes

I made a zine that is basically a doodling book where I included previous submissions to serve as inspiration. Thought this would be a fun thing that people can print off themselves and keep as a sketch book to fill out as something to do after the project is over.

there is a print ready copy, please print is double sided and flip on short edge so it's in the right order!
