Week 8: **High Sheen**. This art was lovingly created using: **FireAlpaca**.

## Artist's Notes

Wow! This was stressful! The time limit and outside stressors made this a particularly bad drawing experience, buuut I did finish this at the very least. There are things about it I would've added or changed if I had the time, but I obviously had to rush, so... oh well.
