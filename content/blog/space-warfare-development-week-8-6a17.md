Week 8: **High Sheen**. This art was lovingly created using: **Traditional art.  Copic markers and pens, gell pen.**.

## Artist's Notes

Spicy Tuna  

A delicious Japanese meal for lunch - a bowl of spicy tuna and rice with chopped onion garnish, along with a cup of maccha.  
I applied the photo texture to the maccha cup, the rice bowl, and the ground tuna.  I drew in gel pen white on the cup and bowl surfaces to simulate ceramic gloss.  Light reflections can come from any angle on a glossy surface, I made decisions on what parts of the artwork were to be covered up.  Decisions were made (mistakes were made ^^).
