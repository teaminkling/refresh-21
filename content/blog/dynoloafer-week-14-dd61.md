Week 14: **Absolute Fire**. This art was lovingly created using: **Paint Tool SAI**.

## Artist's Notes

I was late, sad.  Buut I got this done tho! I've always loved whenever I got the change to draw fire and fire effects. Again, I actually learned a technique on youtube on how to do this, and I think it works out really well for my style! This is dragon Backey (I know they're also cowboys, please don't ask how many alternate universes we have) attacking a rowdy dragon who got too aggro with Prince Astro! He has the powers of fire and Astro has the powers of poison! Both would be painful...
