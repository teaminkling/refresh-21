## Artist's Notes

[Google Docs External Link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CrUiHBniouCtC2vncknVcsFT4cf-kVRzb--YlfKXxWA/edit?usp=sharing)

Decided to use minecraft since I was in quarantine during the vacation and had time. Needed green dye to mix into cyan dye and so I made a cactus farm and built a factory around it. uses mostly blocks and stuff you can make from the dyes (also a little stone). Tried to make it look like it pollutes the river (dug out custom rivers and had them flow into the swamp biome for extra dirty effect). Solved the rhythm part by making a noteblock drum-kit in the factory. 
it's a statement because I was inspired by the Citarum river in Indonesia, most polluted village in the world. Also has textile factories.
