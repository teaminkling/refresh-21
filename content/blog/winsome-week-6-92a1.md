Week 6: **Simple Love**. This art was lovingly created using: **Modelling Clay (Sculpey)**.

## Artist's Notes

A lot of people give chocolates for Valentines and other romantic holidays. I'm not a huge fan of chocolate but I really like the little gourmet ones. I think these ones will last a little longer than most.
