## Artist's Notes

So this is it! This is finale of 17 weeks of Designrefesh! I participated in this awesome community since week 5 and haven’t dropped a single prompt! I’m proud of myself for this commitment. Thank you @cindry for hosting and everyone who helping and participating! You all inspired me to stick to this all along. I’m thankful for the opportunity to meet you all here! 
I come up with this submission with a lot of thoughts. My heart went way back to the 4 weeks that I missed out and how to capture them all in this piece (So I can finally say I did all 17 weeks haha)

Week 1: Yellow Line

Week 2: Deep Ocean

Week 3: Red Circle

Week 4: Murky Silhouettes

Special thanks to @papapastry as the website had saving me time scrolling all the way back!

So here this is my work, and I hope you all enjoy as much as I did.

Week 17: combined of the above 4 prompts

 I love you all even we don’t know each other ❤️

And remember

*“the light that's shining

Deeper than the eyes can find it”*
