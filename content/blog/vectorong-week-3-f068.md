Week 3: **Red Circle**. This art was lovingly created using: **Vector illustration**.

## Artist's Notes

Rather than a finalized illustration, I wanted to use this week as a way to push myself to complete a concept art for a story I've been slowly developing. A lot of the story revolved around shapes with very graphic elements, so I wanted to push that and also do a medium completely different from the previous weeks.
