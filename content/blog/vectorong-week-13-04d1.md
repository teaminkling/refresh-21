Week 13: **Look At Me**. This art was lovingly created using: **Mixed media (plaster strips, paper clay, paint), Photoshop**.

## Artist's Notes

Inspired by the song Bad Dream by Tatsuya Kitani (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkYeBXXHgY4)
*I'm forced to live a meaningless and unreasonable tragedy
Who the hell said “after rain comes fair weather”
I can't imagine this bad dream ending*

The mask is referencing a Hannya mask that's used in Noh theater, which is used in the performances to depict female demons that are filled with jealousy. The traditional mask, depending on the angle it is viewed, can show either a demonic or tortured expression. I've also been intrigued by the themes in Japanese horror stories, which often focus on building the suspense, and the duality of tragedy and anger in vengeful spirits.
