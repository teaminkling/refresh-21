Week 3: **Red Circle**. This art was lovingly created using: **Charcoal, Acrylic, and Watercolor on paper**.

## Artist's Notes

Desc: A photoshopped composition focused around the red circle. The circle is embraced by the hopeful and the hopeless. The circle is prominent in the light and the dark. The circle is constant in each instance. Layered over by each passing entity, immovable from its position.
