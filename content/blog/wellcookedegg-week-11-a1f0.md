Week 11: **Atmosphere Spectrum**. This art was lovingly created using: **Clip studio paint**.

## Artist's Notes

Pressed enter before I put stuff by accident lol

"Castle in the Sky" is one of my favorite movies of all time, so I figured I'd draw something inspired by it. The castle's name is Laputa, so I named the piece accordingly.
