Week 3: **Red Circle**. This art was lovingly created using: **Traditional, Copic markers & pens**.

## Artist's Notes

I took a regular goldfinch, and jammed it full of steroids and heavy metal.
"Beware the red moonlight,
Across the Black Forest night,
The deathwings in the tree,
Kill everything they see."
