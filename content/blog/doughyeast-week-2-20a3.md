Week 2: **Deep Ocean**. This art was lovingly created using: **Procreate**.

## Artist's Notes

Manga-inspired illustration where a warrior meets their maker in the Deep Realm <a:JamCat:768213145008210012> 

( Resubmitting the piece I had just done, because I was honestly disappointed in how much of the hatch work was covered and I didn’t want to do another red piece this upcoming week. Had to switch it up!  )
