Week 11: **Atmosphere Spectrum**. This art was lovingly created using: **Relief printing**.

## Artist's Notes

Based on my initial wonder (and subsequent terror) of the galaxy, where I would try to find my favorite constellations in the night sky. There's a lot of a parallels to the ocean; so unknown, beautiful, yet also terrifying to think about in its vastness. Also a reference to myself and my group of friends, since many of us happen to be born during the Cancer season. ~~Crying crustaceans where u at   ~~
