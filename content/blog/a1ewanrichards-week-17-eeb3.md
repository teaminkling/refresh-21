## Artist's Notes

[REVISED, REUPLOAD] This is my own refresh/summary of my past works, with in-depth elaboration for each work. Each entry is lengthy, so for the sake of the actual showcase, please read the foreword and the Week 17 instead, especially the finale where I wrote something special, hopefully.

A big up to @vectorong  and @cindry  for the zine inspiration, though mine looks more like a "calen-zine" than a book-type zine, but whatever. I'm going to have it printed, anyway.

Thank you for everything. Love you all. ðŸ¥°
