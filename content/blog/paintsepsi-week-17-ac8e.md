## Artist's Notes

wowwww, another side profile of an anime girl, how creative of me.... I tried to incorporate some of my previous works in this piece... Week 1 - with the yellow background, Week 3 - Red Circle with the red earrings, Week 4 - Murky silhouette with the persona style art, Week 8 - high sheen from jimmy neutron, Week 9 - the devil girl that I drew, Week 10 - Folds and folds and the anime style. These past few months have been so fun and challenging, I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to partake in the design refresh and to even co-host. I would like to thank everyone involved and I really am so happy to have been able to meet so many other artists on Twitch. Without this I would have never met HadesPsd. Peace, stay hydrated, with a can of pepsi.
