Week 3: **Red Circle**. This art was lovingly created using: **Felt and ink on paper**.

## Artist's Notes

I looked up the flag of Okinawa and it was perfect with what I had in mind. The man in the center is a sketch of Kamejiro Senaga, one of the pioneers of the peace movement in Okinawa to expel the US bases hosted in the islands. "Gui" is the title of a composition by Japanese composer Ryuichi Sakamoto created for a feature film about Kamejiro's life.
