Week 11: **Atmosphere Spectrum**. This art was lovingly created using: **FireAlpaca**.

## Artist's Notes

Kinda been stressed this week, but I managed to squeeze this piece out. Sketchier lineart than usual because it's literally a sketch that's cleaned up a bit lol, I'm tired and need to study for a test :p 

Also check <#794059396165926913> for a sketch done by DynoLoafer that's basically what the guy looks like from the front lol
