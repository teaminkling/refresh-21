Week 17: **The 4 R's: Finale**. This art was lovingly created using: **Ableton Live 10/11 Suite, Steinberg Cubase 5, FL Studio 12/20, & DaVinci Resolve**.

## Artist's Notes

Hey team, this 8-minute video would do best when left to last. Thanks!

Submission 5/5.

I took a work from every week (without repeats of artists) and wrote 30 second shorts for each one. Most of these shorts are from work that I wrote in the past that has not seen the light of day.

Video features visual work by @jorchael_p, @Scimister, @DoughYeast, @fonz, @cindry, @TheLagExpert , @Goblet, @soleilboo , @arancil, @TITAN011, @paintsepsi, @vectorong, @Pumpkan, @Piacine , @eggyolk, and @a1ewanrichards.

Sorry for leaving people out, but there are only 17 weeks and I went for easiest to match to audio as my main selective metric.

That's it from me. Thanks for listening!
