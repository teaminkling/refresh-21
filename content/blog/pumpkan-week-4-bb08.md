Week 4: **Murky Silhouettes**. This art was lovingly created using: **procreate**.

## Artist's Notes

i read a cool tumble post about a botanist burying a lamb bone under a tree and when they came back a few months later the tree had completely absorbed it. Left it to the last minute so it’s not exactly what I had in mind but better done than not so 🤷🏻‍♀️
