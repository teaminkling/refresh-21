Week 16: **Scaling Giants**. This art was lovingly created using: **Clip studio paint**.

## Artist's Notes

So this is an idea have had since week 7, but I didn't have the time to pull it off and also had too many ideas for that week. However I honestly think it fits with this week's theme better ðŸ˜›
So this is based off the poem "Ozymandias" by Percy Bysshe Shelley. Good poem, go read it. This is also my first real go with Clip studio and trying to make a webtoon/uploading a webtoon.
So yeah, go read it ðŸ˜˜
(Don't worry, it's short)
