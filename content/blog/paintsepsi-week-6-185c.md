Week 6: **Simple Love**. This art was lovingly created using: **Photoshop**.

## Artist's Notes

I wanted to do a non paint style for this one and was hugely hugely inspired by elliotisacoolguy on twitch and made something in his style. The title comes from this great The 1975 song, recc you all listen to it!. I made a few options just to make it a bit more interesting
