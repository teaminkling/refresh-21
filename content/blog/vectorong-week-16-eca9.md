Week 16: **Scaling Giants**. This art was lovingly created using: **Graphite**.

## Artist's Notes

The idiom is defined as "an endless, self-defeating, or pointless pursuit...The term is commonly associated with an exhausting, repetitive lifestyle that leaves no time for relaxation or enjoyment."~~(thanks wikipedia)~~ The concept was initially sketched out two years ago, but quickly shelved after major life events and and work affected my ability to put effort into it. I felt like it was the right time to come back and finish it, especially as I'm currently at a point of trying to find a lifestyle that is sustainable yet enjoyable for me as I currently am. Despite how small rat skeletons are in actuality, the piece is the largest I've ever worked with pencil - the drawing itself is around 122cm / 4ft in height.
