Week 2: **Deep Ocean**. This art was lovingly created using: **2 page comic, Ink on Paper**.

## Artist's Notes

Wouldn't it be weird to find light in a deep ocean dive? Kinda scary if you ask me.

I love the idea of discovering something once lost, unsure if peaceful or dangerous waiting to be explored. 
Really just inspired by series like Made in Abyss and Jigokuraku!

(thank you to everyone who joined the 11 hour stream crunch getting this done!! LOL)
