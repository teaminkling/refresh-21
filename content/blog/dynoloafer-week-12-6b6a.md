Week 12: **Visual Words**. This art was lovingly created using: **Paint Tool SAI**.

## Artist's Notes

I made it after all, sweet! Anyways, I decided to use a sharp type of typography I've used in the past to help emphasize the power in this picture. Yes this is the gay cowboys (I draw them both as humans and as people.) No spoilers for part 2, (part 1 is finished) but someone is struck by a smooth criminal.. and not in a fun way.
