Week 12: **Visual Words**. This art was lovingly created using: **Procreate**.

## Artist's Notes

English is my second language and I’m having fun with all suffix and prefix. Google said “dis” =  “a Latin prefix meaning “apart,” “asunder,” “away,” “utterly,” or having a privative, negative, or reversing force.... Also my art always revolving around my daily life so this work inspired by this week little getaway trip... I’m disappeared into nature now....
