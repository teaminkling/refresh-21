Week 1: **Yellow Lines**. This art was lovingly created using: **FireAlpaca**.

## Artist's Notes

I wanted to draw my oc in a dress, so I drew him in a dress! He likes wearing dresses from time to time. The sketchy plants in the bg are mostly to fill the space, but I thought they would look nice :)
