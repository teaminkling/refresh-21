Week 4: **Murky Silhouettes**. This art was lovingly created using: **Procreate**.

## Artist's Notes

SO, I started a concept on stream, I wasn’t happy with it, and then continued working on it until it became completely different (other than being P5 related). So now I’m here, 4 hours later, with a different piece. I love the use of silhouettes in P5 and it just clicked with me to do something related to it for this submission! I hope y’all like it!!
