Week 4: **Murky Silhouettes**. This art was lovingly created using: **Felt pen on paper**.

## Artist's Notes

I actually struggled with the theme, but this came suddenly one day ago. Killing of farmers is still an issue in the Philippines as they struggle for genuine and lasting land reform. January 22 was also the anniversary of the Mendiola Massacre, where 13 farmers were killed when police dispersed a large farmer's protest. Landlessness and vestiges of feudalism remains to this day.
