Week 16: **Scaling Giants**. This art was lovingly created using: **Paint Tool SAI**.

## Artist's Notes

(a small TW for alcohol and drug abuse) I decided to draw not my most favorite pokemon for this week, but the pokemon I respect* the most. Lugia's past is quite depressing. The creator of Lugia, Takeshi Shudo, heavily relied on alcohol, pills and even *tranquilizers* to get his mind in the workspace, which sadly isn't an uncommon practice with creators. Lugia was supposedly supposed to only show up in Pokemon: The Movie, but it found it's way in the game. She was supposed to represent *life and maternity. She was supposed to be the Goddess of the Sea, mother of life. Buuut, sadly the details were taken out of Shudo's grasp, and Lugia became a genderless legendary. They even made her a psychic type because, quote "We wanted to make it more powerful."
It's disappointing and disheartening to see what happened to this deep-ocean beauty. The bastardizing of Shudo's ideas caused him to fall into a great despair, where he overdosed a few years later. I never knew Lugia's story before, but now that I do, she is the only legendary I look at and feel something. I hope it's the same for you too. She's truly the mother of all glory hidden in Pokemon's lore.
