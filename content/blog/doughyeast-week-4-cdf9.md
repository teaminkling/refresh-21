Week 4: **Murky Silhouettes**. This art was lovingly created using: **Procreate, Pixaloop**.

## Artist's Notes

At Camp Laywick, Raya’s peers are unable to see the silhouette of her distress against the thick of the fog...

yet she is unable to see the silhouette beneath the water...

[ I went for a “cover of a horror novel for teen readers” approach and did some video-editing to further portray rhythm and movement <a:JamCat:768213145008210012> ]
