Week 8: **High Sheen**. This art was lovingly created using: **Digital collage (procreate)**.

## Artist's Notes

I love doing collage my dudes. From brainstorm to submission with was about 75 minutes. The prompt had me thinking about metal in art, so i drew images from photography (silver bromide development) to lithography/etching (metal plate prints) to digital art (like... computers and stuff). The birds are just to cover her nipples
