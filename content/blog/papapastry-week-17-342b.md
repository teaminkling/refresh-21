Week 17: **The 4 R's: Finale**. This art was lovingly created using: **Ableton Live 11 Studio**.

## Artist's Notes

Submission 3/5.

Preamble:

I planned to do a colossal anthology of pieces, week after week, each with different artists to create a storyline and a concept EP in addition to the five pieces of work I actually did for the final week of the refresh. The planning document I have for that clocks in at just under 2,000 words, uses art from 16 artists, and is a coming-of-age story about an immortal wizard. Nobody wants to hear that.

In either case, I'd need to take leave to have enough time to write that much music. Anyway:

When @TrixyNetex submitted SOL 0 in Week 7, I remarked how similar it was to official modern NASA concept art for space tourism. I've always been fascinated with the idea of personification of robots for music and art, so I wrote a song around that idea.

Also, I don't like making excuses for my singing but I underwent major dental surgery before singing. Probably shouldn't be singing, but it's already done so...
