Week 9: **Bold Strokes**. This art was lovingly created using: **photoshop**.

## Artist's Notes

Tomorrow I will compete in my Jiu Jisu tournament so I try to keep my mind calm and did something related to my feelings. the moment I'm on the mat is the moment I feel alive. 6 mins. only 6 mins to see how far I have become compared to myself yesterday. Control my nerves and believe in my techniques, execute fast and believe I've got this. I'll have to go to bed but will watch the VOD later. Have fun and give me some of your energy please!!!! see you all next week!!!!
