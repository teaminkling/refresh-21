## Artist's Notes

Completely dissatisfied with my previous entry, so here's a new one. I've been feeling lonely and isolated lately for so long. I feel that nobody will ever bother to listen or understand me.

My interpretation of Otomatsu Sato from the movie "Poppoya" (Railroad Man), a stationmaster at a former coal mining town, whose train station he mans is about to close. In light of it, he's forced to revisit his past; life events and life that passed him by due to his sheer dedication to his work.
