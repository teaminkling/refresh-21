Week 5: **Royal Green**. This art was lovingly created using: **colored pencils + ink**.

## Artist's Notes

Based off of the jade burial suits of the Han dynasty, which were ceremonial suits constructed from squares of jade and gold thread. There's something very somber for me about these suits, where they are nearly identical and often have jade features placed to represent their face. ~~also remind me never to do colored pencil drawings again cuz its too hard~~
