Week 3: **Red Circle**. This art was lovingly created using: **Ink (+watercolour for the red), a little bit of digital post editing to even out the whiteout and broken paper (PLEASE TEACH ME DIGITAL EDITING SOMEONE)**.

## Artist's Notes

DAMN IT DIDN'T KEEP THE IN CLIPBOARD WHEN DELETING THE SUBMISSION but from memory:

A JoJo-esque pre-fight peacocking scene. Imagine this being followed by the villain capturing the hero from behind, whispering some sort of mockery in the hero's ear with his deep voice. Cue hero thinking "His breath is so cold... It's nothing like how I imagined it!!"
