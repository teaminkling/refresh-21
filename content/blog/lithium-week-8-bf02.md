Week 8: **High Sheen**. This art was lovingly created using: **Digital (Clip Studio Paint)**.

## Artist's Notes

Really just leaned into the original photograph, only removing the outer rim and clone stamping out some of the edge punctures. Took visual inspiration from the recent NASA/Juno pictures of Jupiter, just played with colors and swirls.
