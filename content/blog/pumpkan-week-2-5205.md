Week 2: **Deep Ocean**. This art was lovingly created using: **Procreate**.

## Artist's Notes

Wanted to draw a mermaid. I really wanted to show this massive lady with something strange and unexpected. And those nokia phones are probably the only thing that could survive the crushing depths of the deep sea
