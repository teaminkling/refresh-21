Week 1: **Yellow Lines**. This art was lovingly created using: **MS Paint**.

## Artist's Notes

simple geometry shape of a bowl highlighted using pre-programmed algorithm of MS Paint, the yellow used to demonstrate the 3 dimensionality of bowl... aaaa theres a cat in it .... oh welp if it fits, it sits ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
