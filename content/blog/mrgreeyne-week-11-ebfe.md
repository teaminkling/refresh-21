Week 11: **Atmosphere Spectrum**. This art was lovingly created using: **Few word**.

## Artist's Notes

A smattering of haikus for my first (and late ehehe) design refresh. Enjoy!

I mumble and groan
Basking in her warm embrace
Good morning, sunshine

Just as the wind blows,
As the clouds and trees just be,
I think of nothing.

Accompany me
Ebony night, Lake Shore Drive
What's for dinner, beans?

Unfathomable
Magnificent, glorious
Twinkling far away
