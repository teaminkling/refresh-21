Week 5: **Royal Green**. This art was lovingly created using: **Music/Ableton Live 10 Suite**.

## Artist's Notes

In this technical folk metal piece, I focus on changing textures. The video will explain. This piece is very experimental and not meant for human consumption.

"Royal green" is musical imagery: "cold and hard" sounds like heavy metal and "jade" implies an opulence that cuts through: the kanun and saz instruments.
