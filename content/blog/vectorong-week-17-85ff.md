## Artist's Notes

I find it's always nice to look back whenever you complete a series / project and celebrate, so this is my way of doing so - creating a book with all the pieces I've submitted. I've really enjoyed this challenge and trying all these new mediums, even when I felt like my brain might explode. Also feel free to quickly flip thru this during the showcase, but would love if the artist note at the end could be read - it's a bit sentimental but just wanted to say a small word of appreciation to everyone (book may take a bit to load all the pages, so a warning in advance).
