## Artist's Notes

Nothing fancy for the last week of the design refresh 2021 as I want to take this time to praise all the wonderful artists that submitted their art. It was only a few month ago that a picked up my first drawing tablet and started digital art (I was so scared to even use colors ü§£ ). I can comfortably say that every single one of u inspired me and motivated me to try new things till this very day. Big thanks too @Pumpkan for being the best co-host ever in history ‚ù§Ô∏è  Let‚Äôs also take this moment to give a huge thanks to Cindy for making all this happen and creating one of the best art community on twitch. You‚Äôve being a great mentor to me for these past months and I would have never improved this much if it wasn‚Äôt for you ‚ù§Ô∏è This little subdrake will be supporting ur twitch in the shadows till the next design-refresh  . I don‚Äôt know everyone personally but I just want to say I love all of you and I really hope you all keep drawing cause they is just so much more stories to tell and to draw ‚ù§Ô∏è
