Week 4: **Murky Silhouettes**. This art was lovingly created using: **PS**.

## Artist's Notes

Desc: Silhouette using negative space and texture to bring forward the figure  and clothing. For movement, I went more subtle with hair flow that cuts through the face rather than drawn in. 
Note: save your work...i lost the first draft and finished this 1 hr before deadline
