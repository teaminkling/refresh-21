Week 13: **Look At Me**. This art was lovingly created using: **procreate**.

## Artist's Notes

this is a comic I made with my friends a couple months ago currently we are working on episode 2 after a hiatus and I hope you enjoy the first episode. I put a lot of heart into it and I hope to become a WEBTOON original one day
