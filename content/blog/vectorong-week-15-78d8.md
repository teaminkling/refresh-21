Week 15: **Back to Basics**. This art was lovingly created using: **Food**.

## Artist's Notes

My grandfather loved boysenberry jam, so I made a simple tribute to him and my favorite meal, breakfast. Used a knife and jam to create the basic form of a boysenberry, with bread as the "canvas" and butter to prevent it from getting soggy. ~~Jammin with jam lol~~
