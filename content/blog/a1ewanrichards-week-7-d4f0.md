## Artist's Notes

@rjmmendoza on IG/Twitter | A1EwanRichards on Twitch

It's not a desert in the typical sense. It's an amalgam of sugar cane farms and the concept of "peace of the cemetery," referring to a quote by St. Oscar Romero. The title is a rough translation of a poem by Filipino poet Axel Pinpin, originally titled "Kung Puntod na ang Lupa" (literal: If the Land is a Tomb").
