Week 10: **Folds and Folds**. This art was lovingly created using: **Procreate**.

## Artist's Notes

This one got away from me a bit. I intended to do something simple, I really did. All I really wanted to do was do some stronger posing than usual. I hope this fits within the prompt for this week, shes wearing clothes lmao...
Anyway here is my dnd character Joselynn La Verne being no more dramatic than usual
