Week 14: **Absolute Fire**. This art was lovingly created using: **paper cutting photography**.

## Artist's Notes

This is about burnout and how hard it is sometimes to recognise it while in haste. Just remember to take your time, recognise to take care of your body. Don't burn yourself, it'll take a while to recover!
