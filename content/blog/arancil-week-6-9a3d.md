Week 6: **Simple Love**. This art was lovingly created using: **Trad art, watercolor**.

## Artist's Notes

Interpretation of the prompt; I sat down and did some painting that I simply loved doing, no research, no finding references, no working through a concept, just doing a sketch and putting paint on paper, feeling a harmonious flow in the work itself unlike the frustration I usually feel while doing art. It was kind of nice.

Angled shots in discussion to show off sheen on the gold paint.
