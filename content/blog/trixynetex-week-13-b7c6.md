Week 13: **Look At Me**. This art was lovingly created using: **Sketchbook pro & paint.net**.

## Artist's Notes

Super last minute submission, but I didn't want to miss two weeks in a row!

So you know when you have a plan, but then you realise you did not give yourself enough time? 

...yeah that was me ðŸ˜…

Originally was gonna have like 3 or 4 fake screenshots. But time is a cruel mistress. Heard the prompt was "look at me", and I'm like "oh! I've said that in game! Let's make screenshots."

Anyway, met Thistle, my Curse of Strahd character, and Ireena, the npc we've been travelling with.  ðŸ˜›

Enjoy
