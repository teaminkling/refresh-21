## Artist's Notes

It's been fun. Thanks everyone participating. Seeing everyone's work in this showcase format week by week has been a really great way to share art with each other, inspire, motivate, develop and helping me and others appreciate more things about the work people do as we're enabled to get into closer detail on the what, how & why in regards to the art people do. 

Wanted to do so much for this one, to show appreciation to everyone and their work, but alas, time is a factor, both in terms of ones own life and in terms of deadlines. So I did what I had time for to the quality I had time for and am happy with that - playing with techniques and mediums. Just know that there were plenty more of you I wish I had the time to make something for.
