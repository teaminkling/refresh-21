## Artist's Notes

shutuphamish (twitch)

for a while i didn't have an idea for the final refresh, but i knew i wanted to enter. i missed (a lot) more showcases than i wanted to at the start and only entered twice before this (and really only one good entry) but i've been here the whole time, watching vods and enjoying the submissions! this piece was inspired by @DynoLoafer 's week 15 entry, with the idea that sometimes fruit isn't fruit in the form of their apple dragon. as some of you know into (obsessed with) keyboards and have been tinkering with macropads for a bit. this is my "peach juice" 2% macropad. anyway, sorry for carrying on, enjoy the show!
