Week 9: **Bold Strokes**. This art was lovingly created using: **video**.

## Artist's Notes

i saw a dude making cool advertisement with a TV as background and thought " hmmmm seems easy" then i proceed to do stupid things. my parents saw me do stupid things, and editing is hell. overall i rate the experience 4/10, maybe i would increase the score if I were more familiar with video editing

also youtube bot sucks and should be cancelled. #youtubebotisoverparty
