Week 11: **Atmosphere Spectrum**. This art was lovingly created using: **Procreate**.

## Artist's Notes

** Used the two references above (an image of a dark sunset and a clear midnight sky)* to create some fantastical characters and I had plans to do two more for **Dawn* and **Noon, but time prevails  

I need to stop making non-human things human
