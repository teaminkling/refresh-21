Week 2: **Deep Ocean**. This art was lovingly created using: **Audio (Ableton Live 10) and a Fender Stratocaster**.

## Artist's Notes

- 

- 

- 
- 
Not entirely an aesthetic adherence to the theme but more of a compositional one. A morphing of flowing chords with a watery bongo drum (ocean) moves into a Lydian (scale) section. The main focus of the track was about contrast to adhere to "space": the differences between the size of objects in the ocean. As such it's a bit avant garde.

(yeah it's a bit demo/garage quality but i only decided to join the challenge today heh)

EDIT: I also have an early/meme version (I'll send it after you've seen the "real" version) cindy
