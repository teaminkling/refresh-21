Week 17: **The 4 R's: Finale**. This art was lovingly created using: **FireAlpaca**.

## Artist's Notes

Waaaa, week 17,,, it's here,, and I actually come with a piece of quality (thanks to the extensions lmao). This piece was inspired by @Linalifox's submission for week 4, titled "Blue". Their piece reminded me of mermaids, which reminded me of The Little Mermaid and my merman AU that I have for Backey,,, so I drew him and took the pose from the "Part of Your World" scene in *The Little Mermaid*. Also, I just wanted to sincerely thank Cindry for the design refresh, it has been stressful but I probably wouldn't have made nearly as much art this year so far if I hadn't participated! Much love to everyone for the feedback on my art over these past few months, it has been a pleasure to hear. I may or may not submit another piece because of the new extension? I'll just have to see I suppose lol
