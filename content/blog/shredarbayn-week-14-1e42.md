Week 14: **Absolute Fire**. This art was lovingly created using: **Charcoal & Watercolour on 110gsm Dollar-store Paper**.

## Artist's Notes

With fire on my mind, I thought of Calcifer and how Howl ate the shooting star! (Howl's Moving Castle 2005)

Timelapse

This was my first endeavor with watercolour and wanted to give it a red hot go (haha) I used a charcoal pencil to free hand the foundation which took me approximately 1 hour to accomplish. I followed with the watercolours spending mixed amounts of my time trying to mix what I wanted and painting in sections at a time, taking a further 4 hours to accomplish.

I like to imagine what shootings off around Howl is the fire from the star, casting amazing light and shadows. I found this quite fun to bring to life! 

Howl, the boy who ate a star. Spicy fire spirit ðŸ”¥
