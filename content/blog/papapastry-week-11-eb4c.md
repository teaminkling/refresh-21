Week 11: **Atmosphere Spectrum**. This art was lovingly created using: **Music**.

## Artist's Notes

This song features the feeling of oppressive clouds and weather, harsh harmonies and clashing timbres.

This song isn't "soft" but I wrote it by surrealist writing about the sea, the land, and the sky. I wrote back then: "The concept [is] a man on an island panicking and struggling to survive against the weather and wildlife. He makes it on further and further, surprising even himself. Whether or not he survives is answered by the punctuated and sudden conclusion of the last beat."

(This is an old song of mine. Proper submission next week since this week has been hectic. This song will not appear on the Design Refresh album.)
