Week 17: **The 4 R's: Finale**. This art was lovingly created using: **Procreate**.

## Artist's Notes

Since I had more time than I initially thought, I decided to add a little more to the piece! I don't think I need to say more than I initially wrote in the original piece but I hope you enjoy the Directors Extended Cut of the piece haha
