Week 7: **Disturbed Desert**. This art was lovingly created using: **Photography (shot w/ a Canon 40D)**.

## Artist's Notes

There's often times when I feel like I'm in an internal 'desert', where ideas don't come easily and time slips by. Yet somehow the creative spark is always hovering in between this barren space and the looming deadline, and often I just find myself having to be patient for the right moment rather than to grasp at the sands.
