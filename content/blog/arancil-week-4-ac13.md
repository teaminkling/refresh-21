Week 4: **Murky Silhouettes**. This art was lovingly created using: **Acrylic paint (Magenta/yellow mix for orange, winsor violet with a bit of magenta for the hand)**.

## Artist's Notes

Tried to capture desperation, intensity and passion. Didn't manage to make the indentations left by the fingers the way I wanted - the idea of the situation is someone digging her nails into the back of her lover. Not intended to look like an injury, though... but still happy with it. Posting a second shot with some more reflection to showcase the three-dimensional aspect.
