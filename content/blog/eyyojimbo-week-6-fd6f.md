Week 6: **Simple Love**. This art was lovingly created using: **Procreate**.

## Artist's Notes

I thought I’d do a piece that describes the appreciation I have for the resilience of humankind through the struggles that we’ve faced this past year, and how that strength will continue into the next. Going for a Magic the Gathering vibe. Also, this is my first post so hello!
