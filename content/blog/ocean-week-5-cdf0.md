Week 5: **Royal Green**. This art was lovingly created using: **soapstone carving**.

## Artist's Notes

Although the prompt centres around green jade, I carved a piece of soapstone under the pretense of it as white jade. The design is influenced by a well known chinese poem: Quiet Night Thoughts by LiBai, it describes looking up at the moon and thinking of one’s family at home.
I have lightly inked the carving to contrast the details. I have left the seal face (bottom face that is used to stamp signatures) blank.
