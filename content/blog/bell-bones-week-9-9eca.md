Week 9: **Bold Strokes**. This art was lovingly created using: **FireAlpaca**.

## Artist's Notes

Did something more simple this week since I've been feeling a little burned out. I wanted to do something cooler for this week cuz I liked the prompt buuuut I just couldn't. Either way, this piece was partially inspired by Omori's art style, hope people like it lol
