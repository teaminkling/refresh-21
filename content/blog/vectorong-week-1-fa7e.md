Week 1: **Yellow Lines**. This art was lovingly created using: **Processing (program) + Java**.

## Artist's Notes

Circle created with Java code that randomizes the spiral variance and the stroke; I wanted to challenge myself to learn a new programming language this year since I enjoy using them for both work and side projects. I'd love to be able to do a different medium for each week if I'm able.
