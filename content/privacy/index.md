This website was developed by Inkling Interactive on behalf of FiveClawD.

## Foreword

Both FiveClawD and Inkling Interactive operate under Australian legal jurisdiction. We comply with the Australian 
Privacy Act of 1988 and are strongly protective of our users' data and rights to privacy.

## General Privacy Policy

We will never collect personally identifying information beyond what is necessary for our products and services to
function. For example:

1. You are encouraged to use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) of your choice to mask your Wide Area Network (WAN) 
   Internet Protocol (IP) address.
2. We do not use Google Analytics* or any user-specific analytics software. If there are exceptions, data will be 
   anonymised, and you must opt-in to send telemetry. On top of this, we do whatever we can to comply with the General
   Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union.

\* Please note that we _do_ use Cloudflare and some third party software tools that may collect _nearly_ anonymous user 
data such as general hits from a certain country or browser.

## Divulgence

We will never share our users' information with or without their permission unless legally required. Even if legally
required, we don't hold data we don't need to have to run our stuff.

## Security

We encourage penetration testers to prod our services, decompile works, or otherwise exploit our services with the
strict requirement of divulgence. Divulge exploits to us and give us a reasonable amount of time (at least 30 days)
to patch the security flaw.

We are a small team so all we can give is gratitude, but we will be transparent: once something is patched, and it is
not a risk to divulge, we will make a public post informing people of a patched flaw (if applicable). We will give you
credit as you desire.
