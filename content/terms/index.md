## Permalinking

Permalinking is the act of directly linking to image, video, audio files, or other media on a social media or other
website and it is strictly disallowed on this website.

However, Inkling Interactive provides a provisional license to permalink using chat applications when media is to be
consumed in a transitory form. If you are in doubt, just link to the blog post/submission containing the work to 
which you want to link.

## Intellectual Property

FiveClawD and Inkling Interactive take intellectual property (IP) extremely seriously.

The 2021 Design Refresh respects international IP law. Content and media on this website is owned by their original 
copyright holders, hosted here via assets pulled from our official Discord community.

Due diligence has been exercised to ensure sufficient attribution and permission to use and showcase IP. Posting 
works to the public Discord community, for instance, is used as implicit permission to post work on this website. 
However, full rights remain to the original IP holder: we just hold the rights to host it to be displayed in our 
application and on our servers.

We will respect the wishes of IP holders present and future. Please contact Inkling Interactive at any time via 
Discord or <a href="mailto:legal@teaminkling.com" target="_blank">email</a> with the subject line "Intellectual 
Property", and we'll get right on that.

Also, Inkling Interactive takes great effort to ensure we are complying with international Intellectual Property (IP) 
law. We make frequent use of Open Source Software (OSS), abiding by licenses as required.
