## What is this?

The 2021 Design Refresh was a community-centered weekly creative art challenge. It ran online from January to May 
and was organised by [Cindy Xu](#cwown).

Many creators worked hard to create work according to a theme every week. At the end of each week, a showcase was 
broadcast [live on Twitch][twitch-cindy] for the community to enjoy.

This website hosts the themes and showcases all entries from the [#2021DesignRefresh][twitter-hashtag].
