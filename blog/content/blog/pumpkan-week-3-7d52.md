Week 3: **Red Circle**. This art was lovingly created using: **Rubber stamp block + ink, procreate**.

## Artist's Notes

Bc this prompt focusses on contrast I wanted to explore black and white stamp printing! This is the 3rd stamp I've done and by far the biggest. I dont have red ink so I had to add that digitally. Kinda bummed that the scan was so unkind to it, but it was a nice change from the stuff I usually do
