Week 4: **Murky Silhouettes**. This art was lovingly created using: **Sketchbook Pro**.

## Artist's Notes

The Search 

Murky, silhouette... well, I must oblige! (It's like you want me to draw spoopy shit) ðŸ˜›
Decided to contrast this with my last two pieces by using mainly lighter values. And since we're looking at movement, thought I'd try and pump in some more overt narrative stuff too.
Enjoy!
