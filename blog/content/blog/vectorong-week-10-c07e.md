ボロボロ ("boroboro") often refers to an item that is worn out to the point where it is in tatters. Rather than throw it out, I find it can be a very personal and relaxing process to repair it, following similar Japanese repairing idealogy where the fix / mend also becomes a point of beauty. The pattern is based on other traditional Japanese patterns - this is one focuses on the imagery of a bobbin and thread to create an almost water-like pattern, which was screenprinted with gold ink, a reference back to Kintsugi which is a pottery repair technique using gold lacquer.

I also included a comparison image for fun and how you can use non-functionality in fast fashion to your advantage.
