"You're a monster, a loon. Everybody wants you dead, including me." Oops, more angst! This is just a nightmare Astro has though, Backey never actually says this lol. Decided to use purposely messy lineart in this piece, I think it looks pretty decent! Astro just needs to stop snooping around in places he shouldn't... Backey doesn't appreciate him reading his journal.
