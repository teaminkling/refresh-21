My favourite music artist Ariana Grande and her sing 34 35.

I wanted to draw her for a while but was never really good enough so I tried again and think this turned out really well

The shiny white on the cardigan jacket thingy is the light to show how it's reflective 
I incorporated the wood in the base of the "snow globe?" Using birch wood and then making the globe shiny to match the theme more
