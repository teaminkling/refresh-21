Week 6: **Simple Love**. This art was lovingly created using: **Sketchbook Pro**.

## Artist's Notes

The late nights we stay up talking about D&D. Those quiet moments when the rest of the world is asleep. We bounce dumb ideas off each other just to see where they'll land. You have no idea how much I appreciate my Resident Wizard...

On the art side of things; I really enjoy drawing characters and their interactions, and believe it or not, I do like drawing cute things ðŸ˜›
