A change of pace, I think? I couldn't really pinpoint any concept to execute for this week, but this imagery had lingered to me for a few days. Then I also remembered a 1994 poem I read from a book whose title for this I based it from.

The poem is about homesickness and wishing for a better world from a faraway place, a faraway country. It kind of reminds me about our own home in the province, where we had a mango tree where we'd sometimes get unripe mangoes for snacks.

The mango is the national fruit of the Philippines, and are usually in season around the hot and dry season (April-May).
