Not entirely an aesthetic adherence to the theme but more of a compositional one. A morphing of flowing chords with a watery bongo drum (ocean) moves into a Lydian (scale) section. The main focus of the track was about contrast to adhere to "space": the differences between the size of objects in the ocean. As such it's a bit avant garde.

(yeah it's a bit demo/garage quality but i only decided to join the challenge today heh)
