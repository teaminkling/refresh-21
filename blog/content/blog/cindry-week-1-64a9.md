Week 1: **Yellow Lines**. This art was lovingly created using: **Digital, Paint Tool SAI**.

## Artist's Notes

gay rat wedding
I went a bit crazy on SAI which is a huge guilty pleasure. In the end it's a bit cute and a good mood so I'm happy with what I made. Looking forward definitely going to use more references since i should, this is a bit surreal.
