Week 5: **Royal Green**. This art was lovingly created using: **Procreate**.

## Artist's Notes

Pretty busy this week, so something simple. The image of the expensive jade necklace reminded me of my string of pearls plant. Jade symbolises purification, nourishment and growth, so a plant seemed a perfect fit. My little SOP isn't huge and majestic yet, but it grows a little and becomes a little more regal every day
