Week 1: **Yellow Lines**. This art was lovingly created using: **procreate**.

## Artist's Notes

I wanted to do something elegant with pattern. However, when I streamed this like an hour ago, I was aggressively persuaded (bullied) into adding more pumpkins, and now it’s a tarot card of the suit of pumpkins. 🤷🏻‍♀️
