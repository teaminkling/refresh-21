Week 5: **Royal Green**. This art was lovingly created using: **ibispaint x**.

## Artist's Notes

``

I painted the outline for the sword, tried painting the jade texture, but was displeased with the result, so I went and took a photo of the metal part of a local ww2 bunker and used it to make the texture by adjusting stuff here and there. The handle has the original bunker color
