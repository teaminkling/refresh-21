I saw the swirl of the image and straight away wanted to do something kind of surreal but still quick and readable. I won't lie, this probably took a bit over the 2 hour time limit, but I didn't really have a brainstorming session so I'm gonna count it as a work hour. Also I got the day wrong but shhh that adds to the out of touch-ness.
