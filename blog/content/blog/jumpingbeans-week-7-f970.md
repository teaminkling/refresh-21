Week 7: **Disturbed Desert**. This art was lovingly created using: **Krita**.

## Artist's Notes

The huge creature was a character that I had written about, inspired by League of Legend's RekSai and Pokemon's Garchomp. styles influenced by chinese/japanese calligraphy cuz was triggered that i had to do a calligraphy work in non-chinese/japanese materials.
