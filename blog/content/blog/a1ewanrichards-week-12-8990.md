Week 12: **Visual Words**. This art was lovingly created using: **Felt markers and highlighters**.

## Artist's Notes

This one was really hard to make, both physically and emotionally. I felt a lot of things doing this. These... things were borne from both internal and external stuff I've heard throughout my life. I think... that's all I can say for now. I might expand on this elsewhere, IDK.

The concept and title is based from a book by Dr. Bessel van der Kolk, a psychologist who is one of the leading pioneers and specialists of trauma psychology and research.
