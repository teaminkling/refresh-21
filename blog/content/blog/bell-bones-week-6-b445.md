This isn't up to the usual quality of what I make, but I wanted to do something simple since I've felt so overwhelmed lately. Gotta love growing up and facing the crushing weight of your new responsibilities am I right? I'll at least try to make something good for week 17 =3= (also if you want some "giant thing next to a small thing" art that's of actual quality, go look at my submission for week 2 lol)
