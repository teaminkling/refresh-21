Week 15: **Back to Basics**. This art was lovingly created using: **FireAlpaca**.

## Artist's Notes

So... I was late for once. Annnd this wasn't even what I was working on, this is just that same warm up I posted a while back. I probably should've just posted this last week so I could avoid falling into a depression after crumbling under the pressure, but... it wasn't polished, and I didn't want my work on the other piece to go to waste. However... the piece I was working on sent me into a depression spiral where I hated working on it and hated myself for the quality slowly deteriorating as I attempted to render a whole painting in just two days. Moral of the story: don't push yourself too hard. And... learn proper time management lol (although school kinda forced my hand... and I overestimated myself haha). I'll go back to the other piece when I'm ready (since I do still want to finish it), but I'll post what I currently have of it in the <#794059396165926913> channel for those who are curious.

I probably should've just posted this last week so I could avoid falling into a depression after crumbling under the pressure, but... it wasn't polished, and I didn't want my work on the other piece to go to waste. However... the piece I *was* working on sent me into a depression spiral where I hated working on it and hated myself for the quality slowly deteriorating as I attempted to render a whole painting in just two days.
