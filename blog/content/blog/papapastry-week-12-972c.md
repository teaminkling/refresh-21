Week 12: **Visual Words**. This art was lovingly created using: **Music/Ableton Live 11 Suite**.

## Artist's Notes

This week's theme has given me completely free rein on what I wanted to write. I fulfilled the theme entirely through the video. It's visual and it's words innit.

I was going to do kinetic typography but I had ten minutes to learn, which I determined to not be enough time. Songwriting process: noodle two chords, sing in a bathroom, noodle some more.
