My first attempt at digital painting! Meh results, I think.

I tried to recreate this scenery of the Taal Volcano Island in Tagaytay, a popular tourist destination south of Manila, along a steep access road that we crossed during an official business trip where a teammate and I were doing ocular inspections of venues from the recently-concluded 30th Southeast Asian Games.

At that time, I recently had two breakdowns, and a string of realizations stemming from an office crush. And when I saw the view from our service vehicle, I couldn't help but tear up a little. It was so majestic, and made me realize that I had been so preoccupied with my own self that I've forgotten to "stop and smell the flowers," so to speak. I couldn't be bothered to just... be.

The title is derived from the text displayed on the original Japanese theatrical trailer for Takeshi Kitano's 1997 movie HANA-BI.
