Dragon shown (Astro): "Erhm... are you sure all of this jade jewelry is considered attractive? There's so many piercings..."
Dragon offscreen (Backey): "Of course, your Highness! People will swoon for you and your glittery glory."
Astro: "How do you know?"
Backey: "Uhm.. your Highness, word gets around eheh..." (sweating)
...Got this done without stress, yay! Decided to do a dragon design for one of my OC's, whose shown to not like all of the glittery stuff he's forced into as a prince! His assistant Backey says otherwise though... winks. Anyway, had fun with this!!
