Week 12: **Visual Words**. This art was lovingly created using: **Digital (Clip Studio Paint)**.

## Artist's Notes

Ever had anxiety or panic and heard the word relax? That's a bit of what I tried to capture here. The inner font with harmful/intrusive thoughts I made from my own handwriting and you can download it (linked in next message) and use it if you like.
