Week 7: **Disturbed Desert**. This art was lovingly created using: **Procreate**.

## Artist's Notes

Everyone have their own desert to carry. And flower can grow in the desert you know ðŸ™‚ 

Inspiration: orange sand colour of Australian desert and Goodenia-one of Australian desert Plants 
Combined with my goal of digital portrait painting this year. 

Hope you all enjoy this work. 

And yes flowers can grow in the desert.
