TWO HOURS! incoherent eldritch screeching
Firstly: WHY!!!
Secondly: I would like the record to show that I did in fact completely this piece within the two hours (brainstorming included)

So for this I figured we'd go back to "basics" and hop on board the spoopy train. Since the og pics were from a church, I started thinking along the line of angels, creepy angels... then got inspired by Peter Mohrbacher's angel paintings and ended up with a Dark Souls boss  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Regardless, I'm very happy with this one.

Also, the texture from the original picture was used in the hat/disc, the streamers(?) and the ground, and I used the pics of the mosaics for the clothing, in case people were curious üòä
