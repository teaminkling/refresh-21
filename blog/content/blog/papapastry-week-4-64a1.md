"Murky silhouettes" sounds metal and I got my wisdom teeth out so I couldn't really do what I usually do.

"Tone" reminds me of a sick and phat guitar toan that has "value." "Rhythm" obviously means blastbeats and "movement" means the movement of the head up and down as the music flows through your soul and out your butt.

"Monochromatic colour" to me means it shouldn't have any melody and "background colour" is "black" as in "black metal."
