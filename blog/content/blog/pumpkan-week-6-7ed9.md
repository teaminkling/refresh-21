Week 6: **Simple Love**. This art was lovingly created using: **Procreate**.

## Artist's Notes

I love doing character design, and with simple love the first thing I thought of was Madoka and magical girls. For ‘balance’ I made her very symmetrical. She’s inspired by roses. I can imagine her on a team of flower magical girls fighting against weed monsters of the week. Very Tokyo mew style! I wanna draw their whole team...
