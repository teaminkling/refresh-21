Week 4: **Murky Silhouettes**. This art was lovingly created using: **video/photoshop**.

## Artist's Notes

took a video while i was lightly messing around on the pole and here we are..! thought the glitchy parts would be a fun way to transition between clips. i love playing with silhouettes when i dance and thought this may be a cool idea to encompasses murky shadows and rhythm/movement too. 

ps: pls turn up the audio it's a bit soft lol
