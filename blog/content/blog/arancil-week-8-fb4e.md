Week 8: **High Sheen**. This art was lovingly created using: **Oil sticks & oil crayons + some paper cutout**.

## Artist's Notes

Printed out the prompt's image - turns out I didn't have any black ink, just color so it looked .. yeah. Took a different approach on each of the two canvas. Finally, after painting was done, I cut out some parts of the prompt image from the paper and just sort of slapped it on.
