Week 5: **Royal Green**. This art was lovingly created using: **Digital (PhotoShop)**.

## Artist's Notes

I wanted to make something that has a backstory so basically i had a friend that loved ninjas and they passed away a few years back so i wanted to do something not just for me but for them so i used the green (jade) as a representation of harmony/peace i hope you like it ðŸ˜Š
