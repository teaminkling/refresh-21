Volume warning.

To play with expressiveness would be the opposite of playing robotically. Adding the "face" to that means it's also about passion and improvisation. When you add the voice, it's about falsetto, belting, loudness, distortion, mistakes, and roughness.

Lines means melody lines, emphasis is about progression/phrase changes over time. "Look at me" represents the boisterous pride of what is being sung and represented.
