Throwback to that time I did a graphic design degree. The hardest thing I find when designing is deciding what stupid pointless words to put on the page. I feel like, especially at uni, a lot of words are there to look pretty and have no message. I wonder if that just means I have nothing to say? (How can I be so opinionated and have nothing to say?) 
Maybe this is less 3D than I could have experimented with, but it felt comforting to just open indesign and mess around
