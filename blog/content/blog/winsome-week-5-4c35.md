Week 5: **Royal Green**. This art was lovingly created using: **unknown medium**.

## Artist's Notes

The prompt immediately made me think of the Rathian from Monster Hunter, the female counterpart to the series' flagship monster Rathalos. I tried to follow the prompt resource on recreating the jade effect using a small jade dragon as a reference.
