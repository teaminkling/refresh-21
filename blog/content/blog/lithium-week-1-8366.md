Week 1: **Yellow Lines**. This art was lovingly created using: **Digital (Clip Studio Paint)**.

## Artist's Notes

An eight point radial design in the style of a compass rose. Lines are all in the Pantone Yellow, while the background is two shades of blue: classic blue (2020's Pantone color of the year) inside the design and a darker contrasted blue outside of it.
