Fruit doesn't really make a lot of noise, at least nothing that sounds pleasant. My banana ocarina was not shelf-stable.

But I get what Cindy's trying to do here. The analogue for basics for musicians is, I dunno, first pieces? Drills? Fur Elise? Wonderwall? Well, I learned music production using FL Studio (Fruity Loops) which is a funny coincidence, so I'll use that. Everything I wrote when I was younger (12), I put on Newgrounds Audio Portal. This song may bring back memories for you as it does for me.

Note: Please turn the volume all the way up. Might not be loud enough even then.
