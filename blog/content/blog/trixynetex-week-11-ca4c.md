Week 11: **Atmos. Spectrum**. This art was lovingly created using: **Sketchbook Pro**.

## Artist's Notes

I love the sky at dusk, a storm looming on the horizon. The brilliant colours doomed to a few moments before the sky grows dark and the rain begins. That liminal space where you just look at the sky in awe.

Trying to get better at digital painting. Think I got the vibe at least ðŸ˜Š
