Whoopsies, I'm late again! Oh well, school finals are happening right now and, particularly in math (I'm a grade ahead of my peers in it) homework likes to pile up. But, even if I'm late, I know that this would've came out really bad if I rushed it, so I took my time and.. would you look at that! Apple dragon with an apple <:CattoBlush:800558786372173824> So you know, this creature design is not owned by me; that would belong to the developers of Creatures of Sonaria (it's on Roblox, good game) ((yes I know it's roblox shut up)) But, I did make the skin! Soo yea, hope you like it!
