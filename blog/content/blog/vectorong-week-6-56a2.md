Week 6: **Simple Love**. This art was lovingly created using: **Origami + ink**.

## Artist's Notes

Going back to my first art love - paper. I've always been surrounded by paper and origami ever since I was kid, and wanted to pay homage to both my roots and the medium that has so much potential. Also I've been wanting a piece to bring in the two parts of my heritage in one piece; my last name roughly translates to 'ferry across the river' and my chinese name means 'yellow love lotus'.
