subject matters of artists like Edward Hopper tends to place equal weight for the furniture and the human matter, for example, the parallelism of the shapes of his human subject and non-human subjects, the compositions as well. Edward Hopper has invoked thought within his audience, how important is life? Are our lives just as unimportant than the furniture we buy? Despite his work is influenced by post war America, it can resonate to his audience even in contemporary times. 

Most people would agree, giant scaly creatures were killed by a  zooming rock, how much of this event lead up to the development of the homo genus, will anyone of us be here? Through death we start a new, just like creativity, starting a fresh might require one to give up everything and start anew. 

Another thing I have realised is that there are always really beautiful scenery most of the time (e.g. sun sets, beautiful cloud formations), however, before, when I was still busy with life, I was never able to enjoy them. Now that I am forced to slow down my pace, I am definitely more appreciative to take about 5 to 10 minutes to look up and look far.
