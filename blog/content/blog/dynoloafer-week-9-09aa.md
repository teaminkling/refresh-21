Desc: Wow I'm the first one submitting this week? That's weird. Anyways, I decided for this week to draw a bunch of dragons because I couldn't decide on just one with all the thumbnails I made! Each piece has it's own title, as well as a color palette of only 10 colors (9 not including black) and wow it makes this bright! From top to bottom, left to right, the titles of these pieces are _Red, Blue, Zen, Zap, Sunset, Power,  and Skill._ I tried using symmetry and mood to make these pieces work well beside each other, and I think it really came out well! Not much of a story behind this one, but you may interpret it however you like. Fun week!
