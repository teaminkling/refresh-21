Week 5: **Royal Green**. This art was lovingly created using: **Photoshop**.

## Artist's Notes

This is my first time using photoshop for art, i tried making the short sword the centre piece of the piece, and i think the eyes make it pop. Hope people realise this is Itadori Yuuji from Jujutsu Kaisen
