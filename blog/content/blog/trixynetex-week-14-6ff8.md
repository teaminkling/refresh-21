Week 14: **Absolute Fire**. This art was lovingly created using: **Sketchbook Pro**.

## Artist's Notes

Let's draw another one of my D&D characters, because dang it! Why not!?
Met Athenaeum; tiefling lore bard/warlock and general wielder of hell fire.
So fun fact, when I started digital art about a year ago one of my first pieces was of Ath doing neato flame shit. Thought I'd revisit the concept with this one.
Very pleased with how it turned out ðŸ˜Š
