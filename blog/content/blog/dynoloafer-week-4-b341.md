Desc: Whew, this one was close! Sucks that I had to kinda rush at the end because this was submitted on a school night, but I think it still came out really well! I hope his expression scares you because it's supposed to lol. The only story I'll give is something/someone hurt his boyfriend pretty badly and he's not happy about it. Though, it hasn't happened yet! ✨ The Fuuuutuurree ✨
