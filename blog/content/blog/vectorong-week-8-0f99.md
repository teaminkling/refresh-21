Week 8: **High Sheen**. This art was lovingly created using: **Photoshop**.

## Artist's Notes

A visual ode to my need for repetitious tasks and the nonsensical thoughts that pass through my brain when I'm half asleep. I love focusing on the materiality of objects and photos, so I focused on using just pieces of the photo to construct an abstract image and let it tell its own story.
