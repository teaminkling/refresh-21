Week 16: **Scaling Giants**. This art was lovingly created using: **Photo + Procreate**.

## Artist's Notes

I've been feeling nostalgic for blue skies and pub crawls in the city. Here's a shot from 2017 from a bar verandah, now ssssswarming with ssssssnakes. Taking it easy on the wrist still, but I had enough in me to make this!
