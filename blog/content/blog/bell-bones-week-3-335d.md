Wasn't sure if I was gonna finish on time, but I managed to get these done! I finished watching a let's play of OMORI recently, and it was wonderful experience... I felt inspired to draw little battle portraits of my OCs in the game's style! Was gonna draw their real world counterparts, but I... don't have the time nor energy. Either way, here's Astro and Backey as kids, aren't they cute?
