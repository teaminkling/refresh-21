"In the year 20XX
Every living being on Earth
Is late for dinner"

Had to redo the whole thing after being unhappy with the first go at it - and I feel like the "SPACE" keyword wasn't given any justice. I have some ideas on how it could have been dealt with better, but alas, we'll just see that as part of the lesson and learning. Looking forward to getting a better camera & lighting opportunities.
