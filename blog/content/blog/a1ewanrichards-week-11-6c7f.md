I first conceptualized a starry universe portrait theme of sorts, but I thought a landscape would be better. This is my first time using oil pastel.

The flying figure is my interpretation of a "bakunawa," a serpent-like dragon in Philippine mythology, who is said to cause various natural phenomena, such as eclipses. It was said that people would shout at the sky, pleading to give the moon back to them during eclipses.

"Undercooled" is derived from a 2005 song by MC Sniper, composed by Ryuichi Sakamoto as his call for the world to "cool down" in the aftermath of 9/11.

As I kept on drawing, it became apparent that, in line with the song's theme, this would be my prayer of sorts for the world, and my country, to "cool down" and for a return to normalcy after a whirlwind year.
