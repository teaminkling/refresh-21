Desc: First week where I did stuff, hah! I hope I can start to follow the weeks more now that I exist here. You might recognize the character on the left, and if you do, then you'll know who my friend is lol. These two boyos have a lot of story put into them, and I know a lot more about the Wild West than the average person might suspect. Basically the one on the left was an outlaw and the other was a bounty hunter who got him off of the hanging offenses and basically stuffed him into his house.
Don't you worry, it's very gay
