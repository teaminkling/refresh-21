im clown, im illiterate, face go brrrrrrr (had to resubmit, the previous submission had weird colouring issues <:ThankEgg:797490219716050954>)

edit: redid the gif, its still giving the weird coloured background thingy, even though on my comp its not like that, idk whats going on, so i guess its epilepsy warning.
