GUESS WHOES FIVECLAWD MERCH ARRIVED TODAY!!!!
#notsponseredjustexcited
Thought I'd draw last week's CMYK Dragon jacket and pair it with the Perseverance shirt cause who doesn't want double dragons?
Bit of a quick one today cause running out of time. Yes, I did use a photo of my shirt for the shirt. No, I am not copy Cindy's dragoon by hand, how much time do you think I have!?!
