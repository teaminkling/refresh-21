Week 3: **Red Circle**. This art was lovingly created using: **Audio (Ableton Live 10)**.

## Artist's Notes

Red circle was Japan for me this week. It should be obvious where I went with that in the recording.

To me "garnet red" meant a very bold sound that's not lowkey at all. Gems are formed under pressure, which to me means heavy distorted guitars, improvisation, garage drums, intentional but fun mistakes in instrument runs, and a very fast tempo. I took "shape" to mean "shape of a barred chord on a guitar" so I played the guitar. "Contrast" to me meant having a long winding bridge with different soloistic parts.

Feat. a very special guest
