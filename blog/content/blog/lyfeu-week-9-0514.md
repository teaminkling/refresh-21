Week 9: **Bold Strokes**. This art was lovingly created using: **Photoshop**.

## Artist's Notes

A soul entrapped in a body of rock burning its desire to live once more enabling the rock to become its own , the colour at the top i feel is where the soul of the fire and spirit clashing and trying to compromise with each other to both live within the body
