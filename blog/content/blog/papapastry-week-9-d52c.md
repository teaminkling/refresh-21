"Bold strokes" sounds upbeat, aggressive, complex, and coloured by live instrumentals.

Before the 'rona there was live music. For those who have not been in a crowd or performed contemporary music, there is nothing like it. Every mistake, every ad lib: the energy is secondary to nothing. It is extremely obvious when watching some of the best bands out there that everybody is having so much fun.

I spent an actual long time composing this, but not as long mixing it. Consider it demo quality.

Notes: everything you are seeing you also are hearing (no miming). The guitar at the end was done in one take as I started to panic.
