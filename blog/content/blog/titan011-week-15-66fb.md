Week 15: **Back to Basics**. This art was lovingly created using: **Clip Studio**.

## Artist's Notes

Decide to try something new this week so i tried animation for the first time...yea...its hard 🥲 Could only use 24 frames cause of clipstudio's restriction. Does anyone have any recommendation for 2d animation software? 🎞️
