Week 14: **Absolute Fire**. This art was lovingly created using: **Watercolor**.

## Artist's Notes

Still very much a work in progress, but posting what's currently on paper. Friend asked if I could make something for his wall, so I sat down and improvised some stuff, did a refined version, then an A3 sketch, now lightboxing it up to watercolor. Didn't have time to do something for week 14, but this happened to line up with having flames, so why not! The thoughts I did have about something DesignRefresh were focused around calm, comforting fire providing warmth & a safe haven. 

Forest w/ blue flame wisps, foxes & birbs rorodoAAA congregating around a big owl statue. Lore yet to be determined.
