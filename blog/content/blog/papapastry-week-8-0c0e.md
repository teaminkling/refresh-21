Alternative title: playing around with Live 11's new cool features.

"High Sheen" reminds me of a few things. Getting high (on life) in a club, shiny lights from the sun and from stage lights, bright, natural naive feelings. "Sheen" of youth, so to speak, and stuff I have nearly no experience with at all. Clubs aren't really clean, kids.

This was a speedrun. I composed, mixed, wrote lyrics, recorded, and mastered everything in 58 minutes. Composition could not haven taken any longer than 10 minutes.

The melody was written using nerd magic and code based on the image file Cindy posted.
