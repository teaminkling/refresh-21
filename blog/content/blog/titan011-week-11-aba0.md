Week 11: **Atmos. Spectrum**. This art was lovingly created using: **Clip studio**.

## Artist's Notes

Decided to utilize everything I’ve learned in these past few months (perspective, anatomy, value, color etc.) Conclusion: this was a very humbling experience (I was a bit overwhelmed / kinda gave up on the ship towards the end) xD – I will keep practicing  ✍️
