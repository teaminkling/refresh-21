Week 16: **Scaling Giants**. This art was lovingly created using: **Procreate**.

## Artist's Notes

I wanted to draw big egg. Smol soldier. In combination, they make a pretty striking pair. I've been having really out of the world dreams lately, and some of them feel like Neil Gaiman stories, but them sometimes they feel like this piece. It's both familiar and not, something that we've all been feeling after being stuck inside for so long. Hope you like it ❤️
