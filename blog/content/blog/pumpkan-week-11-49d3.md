Week 11: **Atmosphere Spectrum**. This art was lovingly created using: **paper and gold thread and glue and stuff**.

## Artist's Notes

couldn't bare to draw anything this week, so i bound a book. getting the inner pages printed was a goddamn trial, and i wish I had matt laminate for the cover bc the shiny is gross, but I like the little gold thread stars on the front and the shiny paper on the inside makes it feel very dreamy. Making books is fun yo, but lets be real, I'm never gonna actually use this.
