Week 9: **Bold Strokes**. This art was lovingly created using: **Clip Studio Paint**.

## Artist's Notes

I've wanted to express in one way or another this powerlessness I've been feeling for a very long time now. I based part of the concept and the title from a scene in the video game Spec Ops: The Line.
