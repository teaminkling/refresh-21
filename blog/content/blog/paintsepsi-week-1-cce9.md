Week 1: **Yellow Lines**. This art was lovingly created using: **Procreate Digital Painting**.

## Artist's Notes

Basically a portrait of a model but using the Pantone colour of the year as the background. I thought the brightness of the yellow really stood out and so I ended up really appreciating the way it turned out! 

(Sorry hope I did this right lol)
