Week 8: **High Sheen**. This art was lovingly created using: **Digital collage (photopea)**.

## Artist's Notes

The prompt image immediately made me think of a vinyl record so I was thinking of doing something with Daft Punk as soon as I read the prompt. I'm a pretty big fan of theirs and was disappointed to hear that they were splitting up. But boy do they have a metal sheen.
