Week 5: **Royal Green**. This art was lovingly created using: **Digital, Clip Studio Paint**.

## Artist's Notes

There's honestly a lot more to this but the concept was "jade teeth grills" and turned into asian fucc boi. This is like one of those pictures from a high concept idol photo book LOL///

((The bigger project will be worked on but have this pick up line as a sneak peak: Do you like curry? because you looking spicy))
