Week 1: **Yellow Lines**. This art was lovingly created using: **Procreate**.

## Artist's Notes

So I finally finished my week 1 prompt. Full time momma here.  But wanted to share even tho I’m late !

pretty much the darkness symbolizes my emotions how they tend to take over. The sun here is shining light and making me see the positive things in life.
