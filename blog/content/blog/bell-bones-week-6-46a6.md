Week 6: **Simple Love**. This art was lovingly created using: **FireAlpaca**.

## Artist's Notes

After a lot of thinking about the prompt, I'd say that I love to roleplay! Dyno and I rp all the time, so I drew us performing a puppet show! Just to give you an idea, there are 723,445 words across all our rp transcripts including ones that aren't finished lmao
