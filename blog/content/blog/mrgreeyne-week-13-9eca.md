The first thing I thought of when looking at the title of this week's prompt was introspection. I wanted to explore poetry a bit more so I did some reading on limericks and worked with that structure. So the first one titled SeemsGood* is about my general high school experience. The second one titled *Mirror, mirror is about how I used to have a hard time looking at my own reflection. I also recorded myself reading them cause why not? Enjoy!

SeemsGood
I look back and think "god that was tough".
It was just four years, though they were rough.
Grandiose my plans,
Then, well, shit hit the fan.
I stumbled, yet here I stand, proudly scuffed. 

Mirror, mirror
They say pictures hold one thousand words.
A reflection? Perhaps two-thirds?
Stupid, sad, ugly,
Pretentious, pudgy?
Giving them value? Now thats absurd.
