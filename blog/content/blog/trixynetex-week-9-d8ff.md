Week 9: **Bold Strokes**. This art was lovingly created using: **Sketchbook Pro**.

## Artist's Notes

This is what happens when I stare at Hydro74's work for long enough... 
Something very different for me, but I really love how this turned out!
A CMYK Dragon, just for you Cindy ðŸ˜˜
Technically based of the Black Dragons from D&D cause I'm a nerd. Enjoy!
