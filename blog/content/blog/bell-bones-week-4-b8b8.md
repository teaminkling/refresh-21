Week 4: **Murky Silhouettes**. This art was lovingly created using: **FireAlpaca**.

## Artist's Notes

I had the idea to do a cute wild west family portrait featuring the gays(tm) and their daughter, so I went with it! I didn't get to spend as much time on this as I wanted to, but I'm still happy with it (also here's a non-monochrome version lol)
