I've tried, entered, done, a lot of creative endeavors throughout my life, and looking back, it has been quite frustrating, to say the least. This frustration has consumed me over the past several years, and I'm not sure last year was even the peak.

I've sold all my camera gear to help make ends meet, threw away my collection of piano sheet music (much to my older brother's surprise), and I'm not sure where to go from here; I think I've reached my limit, whatever it may be.

I based this on a scene from Takeshi Kitano's 2008 movie "Achilles and the Tortoise," where he based the film plot on the concept of Zeno's paradox in an artistic sense.
