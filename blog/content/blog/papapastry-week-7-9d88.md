(Headphones will benefit you for this song).

"Desert" to me means the mixolydian mode (a tonal "pattern"). You know, like The Beatles (Norwegian Wood, I Feel Fine) and a lot of classic rock around that era. "Space" sounds like space emulation: reverb. The theme also influenced the lyrics greatly, which were written before the music.

Oh, and the video? Yeah, I dunno.
