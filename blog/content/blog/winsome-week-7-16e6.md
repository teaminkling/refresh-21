3 white chocolate caramel souffle cakes to celebrate three different events.

Growth: 1st cake for Herschel's birthday, sadly we missed his birthday party due to lockdown.
Goodbyes: 2nd cake for my roommate who decided his job wasn't worth his sanity anymore and quit.
New Beginnings: 3rd cake for my friend Pete who's moving to a new place!

I originally wanted to make a pun on dessert/desert and made a few cakes to replicate the rolling sandy dunes. Then I decided to add the clay mandrake as a figure that was disturbing the landscape and came across the icing cacti at the shops while getting ingredients. I haven't really done much photography so trying to get the shot I wanted took a while but I think it turned out well.
