Week 6: **Simple Love**. This art was lovingly created using: **Ink on paper, 9x12 inches.**.

## Artist's Notes

Ink on paper, 9x12 inches.

Another week, another rush job lol. I had an initial idea but I dumped it since I couldn't execute it. I made this just now.

Anyway... I tried to recreate the moment I shared with friend and a crush from around 2015. I earlier sent her a message apologizing for "being weird" (not my words) after being scolded by someone for acting weird towards two girls. I sent both of them an apology message, unfriended one of them, but left the other to decide for herself. To my surprise, a week later (this exact moment), she said she wasn't mad at me, and we even embraced in the rain, much to my surprise. I held her shoulders and instinctively said, "We're still friends, right?"

And we've remained friends ever since. Last year, I messaged her, short of spilling my feelings for her, while apologizing for all my awkward moments between me and her. She replied that I shouldn't have to be sorry for it, and even she has had her own realizations.

Recently, she even told me maybe we'd work on a project someday and even referred me to her friend about building a community start up. She's been so kind to me, it actually disarms me.

The title is derived from a piece by Joe Hisaishi for the movie HANA-BI (Fireworks), directed by Takeshi Kitano.
