Week 10: **Folds and Folds**. This art was lovingly created using: **FireAlpaca**.

## Artist's Notes

Ok, so,, I didn't feel like shading, but partially colored lines are cool, right? Anyway, here's an AU version of Backey where he's a prince in a fantasy setting! Figured that an experiment with his design was long overdue lol, people can check <#794059396165926913> to see his og outfit
