Week 7: **Disturbed Desert**. This art was lovingly created using: **FireAlpaca**.

## Artist's Notes

I didn't really get to post many wips for this piece because Discord decided it was too unholy to be seen before it was fully developed, but here it is! Did a screenshot redraw of a place called Scorched Gorge, which a desert area in Bugsnax :3
