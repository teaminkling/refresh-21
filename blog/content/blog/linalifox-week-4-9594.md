I began this piece with a cyan background and started painting in a dark blue. I found it a challenge as I did not have the usual variety of colours to work with, especially with no red tone at all used in the skin. However I eventually learnt to blend the two blues and make them work and thoroughly enjoyed the process. In the sketch phase I focused on creating flow and movement in this piece through the hair and posture.
