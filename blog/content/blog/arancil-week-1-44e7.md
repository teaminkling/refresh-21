Week 1: **Yellow Lines**. This art was lovingly created using: **Ink, watercolour**.

## Artist's Notes

Was originally going for "Plaid & Lace" as my keywords, but ... no way I'm putting down work on the "Lace" part as well. The yellow is "Gold Star" ink from Diamine, the rest is fineliner, uni-ball for white and some cobalt+ultramarine for shaded areas.
