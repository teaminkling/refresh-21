Week 15: **Back to Basics**. This art was lovingly created using: **chinese calligraphy**.

## Artist's Notes

The art philosophy known as "Nanyang Art Style" is a fusion of western and eastern art style. Often, pioneers of this art styles employed western mediums and materials, paired with subject matters of eastern origins / things you commonly see in asia. Some of the pioneering artists are Georgette Chen, Liu Kang etc. 

However, thats not what im doing, im doing a reverse Nanyang Art style, and another art philosophy "Xieyi" (write meaning), where in traditional chinese art is often paired with peotry, yea fuck that, the words is the subject matter and the icon of the respective words are the peotry. 

But, doing this work reminds me, i suck at calligraphy.
