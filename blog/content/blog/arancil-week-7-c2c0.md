Scene: Oh no, one of the remnant forces of the humans are being hunted by the reptilian empire led by Hiss Majesty - but the sand starts rumbling and what rises out of it?

Three panel piece, there's some storyboarding done for the pre-first-panel storytelling as well, but cut it down to two of the nicest looking key panels (+ a dramatic final one). TAKE NOTE OF THE BANDAGES BEING HER SCARF

Inspiration taken from Kamen Rider, Getter Robo G, Gunbuster and the GAINAX pose in general.
