Week 5: **Royal Green**. This art was lovingly created using: **FireAlpaca**.

## Artist's Notes

Finally, something not last minute! I decided to be experimental, doing a lineless piece to try and draw something more simple to avoid deadline anxiety. The hand was originally supposed to look like stone, but it looks more like a bush... so I suppose it's a bush now lol
