## Artist's Notes

Ok, ok, I see your tiny human and large creature entries, but I raise you this,,, large human and tiny creature! But in all seriousness, whaaat, I've drawn something that isn't just a character standing in a void? Shocking! I really challenged myself lol, hope I'll continue to improve :)
