Cutting close again, wowie! Oh well, I like how this came out even if it's just a few doodles of me and my best friend! She's the light of my life and I love her with all my heart, she makes me so incredibly happy and has probably indirectly saved my life. Oh, and she's in the server, so expect a long-ass wall of appreciation in discussions eventually! Happy Early Valentine's Day!! o3o
