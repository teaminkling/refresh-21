Week 4: **Murky Silhouettes**. This art was lovingly created using: **Photo and Adobe Suite**.

## Artist's Notes

this image was captured a few years ago on the southwest coast, at sunset as the sky cleared after a storm. it was already near monochrome, but i dropped the exposure to play with the value a bit
edit: this came out a bit dim in discord yikes

nah 🙂
