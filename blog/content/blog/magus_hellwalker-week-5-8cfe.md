Week 5: **Royal Green**. This art was lovingly created using: **Digital 3D (Blender)**.

## Artist's Notes

Not my model. I tried to model a dragon in 3D but I'm not good at sculpting, but the shading of the model, lighting and environment are my work. Added 4 pin lights to get the translucent jade effect inside the model.
