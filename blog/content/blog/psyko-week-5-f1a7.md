I took a lot of influence from the messy textures created by Jade. I made the loops start from point a to point b and have continuous flow  while adding in different textures through paint splatters, sponges, and various paint strokes. I really just let it happen as I painted, while focusing on trying to create different textures. The loops and waves are my signature style.
