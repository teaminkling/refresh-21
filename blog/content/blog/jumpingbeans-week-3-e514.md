Week 3: **Red Circle**. This art was lovingly created using: **autodesk sketchbook (mobile)**.

## Artist's Notes

felt destructive, might delete later

alternate universal beauty, the demand for universal balance and stability henceforth beauty. this molds the artificiality of man, but how long could one maintain such standards of being toys to the system? 

bonus points for whoever could guess my inspiration :p
