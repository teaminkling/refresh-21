Week 6: **Simple Love**. This art was lovingly created using: **Affinity Photo**.

## Artist's Notes

reminds me of my best friend in the world (we were friends for almost 13 years, till they've moved to Egypt) we still talk, but it's not like before cz we're both a bit busy. Like that heart, our friendship became cold and hollow, with the screens being our only connection. Lol, that's so depressive; anyway, Alexa play Driver's license by Olivia Rodrigo.
