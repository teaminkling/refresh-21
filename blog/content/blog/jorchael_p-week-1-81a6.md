Week 1: **Yellow Lines**. This art was lovingly created using: **Digital, Photoshop**.

## Artist's Notes

I wanted to try play with the rain patterns but rushed them a little. References are godsend. I was going for a minimal editorial look and limited pallette because those are outside of my comfort zone.
