Was going to do something cuter this week and make a lovecore aesthetic piece, buuuut I've just been,, so tired lately. Mom's been keeping me up until 2 am all week for `reasons` so I haven't been getting more than 5 hours of sleep per day... so I decided to convey that through handwritten lettering. I like the ghostly vibe that I stumbled onto. Don't worry btw, I'll rest up... take this simple piece cuz I'm stubborn and want to participate in every week lol
