Week 14: **Absolute Fire**. This art was lovingly created using: **Procreate (and DaVinci Resolve)**.

## Artist's Notes

a piece of an animatic I'm currently working on about an anarchist pig and his contemporaries and their relationship with violence. (edit: it's a little heavy so pls don't be wearing headphones if you're not used to heavy music)
