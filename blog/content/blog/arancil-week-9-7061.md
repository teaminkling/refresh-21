Week 9: **Bold Strokes**. This art was lovingly created using: **Pencil, watercolor, acrylics, promarkers, various fineliners, ink, hands, anger, frustration, stress, acceptance, coffee**.

## Artist's Notes

so this kind of didn't happen as intended, just smashed together everything that had color on it

consider that bit inspired by @DynoLoafer 

Also @jonasw was my spirit animal
