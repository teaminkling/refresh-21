Week 10: **Folds and Folds**. This art was lovingly created using: **Felt marker on paper, 9x12in**.

## Artist's Notes

Drew this earlier at the office since our room didn't have internet since yesterday afternoon. I couldn't think of anything nice, but this came to mind soon enough.

The dance is called "tinikling," where a couple dances between two bamboo poles being clapped to the musical beat. It is somewhat similar to a waltz and a mazurka. 

(My markers are slowly drying out T_T)
