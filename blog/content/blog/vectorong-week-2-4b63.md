Week 2: **Deep Ocean**. This art was lovingly created using: **Gyotaku (traditional jp printmaking method using ink on fish, tho I used shrimp for this so I guess ebitaku lol) + dyed paper napkin**.

## Artist's Notes

I had a dream a while back of seeing a group of shrimp, much larger than possible in real life, and having the feeling I was amidst something otherworldly. Rather than seeing them as food, I wanted to show the shrimp in their element and with regal-ness akin to dragons.
