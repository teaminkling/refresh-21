Week 7: **Disturbed Desert**. This art was lovingly created using: **Procreate**.

## Artist's Notes

When I heard the prompt was about deserts and what lived in them I immediately thought of stardew valley! I love that big dragon skeleton, hungering for the sun. I was aiming for a phone background look, so please feel free to use it!
