80 minute speed draw this time <:klaeiaFeels:731112542956683274> happy with the result though ! inspired by a lot of the stippling i've seen entered by the amazing artists in this week's submissions ! attempted to tie the sand dunes into the hair? no real reason why other than i thought it might be fun to try ;; (to whom it may concern at turnitin, originally submitted at 11:57pm)
