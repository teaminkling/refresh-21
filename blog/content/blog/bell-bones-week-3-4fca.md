Week 3: **Red Circle**. This art was lovingly created using: **FireAlpaca**.

## Artist's Notes

Sooo, week 3, huh? Due to school and my personal life, this came out rather rushed... However, I still like the character design I came up with! The background was inspired by a certain rhythm game, kudos to you if you know the one I'm talking about ;p
