lmao haven't drawn since year 9 and i'm in my mid twenties now so good time to start over

i drew this in around five minutes

context:  woke up at 4pm today and had an hour to write a song. wasn't gonna happen so here's a rerun and some art, and a reason why i shouldn't be allowed near a drawing tablet ever again

tried looking for somebody to credit for the gif, i just found it on giphy ðŸ˜¦

yes i really did render this at 4K

expect two submissions next week
