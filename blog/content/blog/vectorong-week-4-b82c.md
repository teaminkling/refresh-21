Week 4: **Murky Silhouettes**. This art was lovingly created using: **ink + paper collage**.

## Artist's Notes

Delving a bit personal with this piece. Often there's a disconnect between the person I present to others - usually my business persona I use for my work that seems to have everything orderly and 'put together', while my internal self always feels like it's in a state of at least minor chaos and has to navigate the unknown without guidance.
