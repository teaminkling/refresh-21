(Cindy please play this song first).

So of course "fire" means "rapping" but Cindy also mentioned "value", "contrast", "bright", "heart", and "too much." So that's what I used to write the bars.

This is the first non-meme rap song I've ever written. I could have gone down the meme route but it's more challenging if I welcome people cringing at my lyrics and rap voice.

This song will not appear on the refresh album.
