Week 14: **Absolute Fire**. This art was lovingly created using: **Music/Ableton Live 11 Suite**.

## Artist's Notes

(Cindy please play this song first).

So of course "fire" means "rapping" but Cindy also mentioned "value", "contrast", "bright", "heart", and "too much." So that's what I used to write the bars.

This is the first non-meme rap song I've ever written. I could have gone down the meme route but it's more challenging if I welcome people cringing at my lyrics and rap voice.

This song will not appear on the refresh album.

**Week:** 13 [Late]
**Title:** Coming Up Spades
**Medium:** Music/Ableton Live 11 Suite
**Description:**

**Volume warning.**

To play with expressiveness would be the opposite of playing robotically. Adding the "face" to that means it's also about passion and improvisation. When you add the voice, it's about falsetto, belting, loudness, distortion, mistakes, and roughness.

Lines means melody lines, emphasis is about progression/phrase changes over time. "Look at me" represents the boisterous pride of what is being sung and represented.
