Week 4: **Murky Silhouettes**. This art was lovingly created using: **Game**.

## Artist's Notes

I thought I could finish this within 2 days (including learning + execution), ended up having to scrap a lot of the ideas due to my lack of knowledge and sleep deprivation. (definitely not my proudest project, bad coding ethics, cutting corners)
