A one minute gesture sketch turned into a monochrome piece where negative space was used to explore values. Internally mad at the anatomy being off but I promised myself to only work from the gesture and not to spend an hour fussing over making the form precise. It was fun erasing to add value though. also this doesn't really describe the piece at all now does it so um, it's a prancing horse in white over a blue background.
