Interpretation of the prompt; I sat down and did some painting that I simply loved doing, no research, no finding references, no working through a concept, just doing a sketch and putting paint on paper, feeling a harmonious flow in the work itself unlike the frustration I usually feel while doing art. It was kind of nice.
