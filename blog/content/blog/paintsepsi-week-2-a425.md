Week 2: **Deep Ocean**. This art was lovingly created using: **Procreate**.

## Artist's Notes

Since we were talking about Dragons in a previous stream I felt like drawing one... like a sea dragon, those exist right? I rarely draw things like this so I’m a little shy to submit this one, but we’re all learning right?
