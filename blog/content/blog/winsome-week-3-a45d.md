missed the week 2 prompt but wanted to work on the idea. Been thinking about running my own D&D session and was inspired by the grotesque and unknown of classic creatures and came up with a giant deep sea mimic. Wanted to invoke the idea of an angler fish lure but using red instead of the usual blue/white.
