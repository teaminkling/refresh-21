Week 15: **Back to Basics**. This art was lovingly created using: **markers + paper in gif**.

## Artist's Notes

I'm still dealing with wrist pain so I'm making the most of it. What do I have left? A whole other side of my body to learn to draw with! Shout out to LeftHandedToons, a comic site that I spent a lot of time on as a kid. This one's for you
