Didn’t use one color but I tried to stick with cold colors? Worked on value and tones? Is floating considered rhythm and movement? (Honestly idk, still new to all these art vocabulary xD). i hope this respect the rules of the challenge <:PepeHands:779990751429918720>  Implemented some contrast and circle shape from week 3 challenge so I don’t forget the notions I’ve learned.
