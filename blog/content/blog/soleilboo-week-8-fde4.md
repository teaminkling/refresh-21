so as soon as I look at the photo the light caught my eyes immediately. I have been thinking about Wall-E a lot this week because of Do-E, and then I saw Jump in the bin submission which is "trashbin" and then my brain just blink and connect everything together....Here we go, my boy Wall-E using the photo supplied. and I keep it simple. Time finish 1h30mins included the time I make this tiktok little video timelapse below.
