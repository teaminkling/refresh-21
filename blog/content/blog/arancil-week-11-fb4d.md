Week 11: **Atmos. Spectrum**. This art was lovingly created using: **Watercolor**.

## Artist's Notes

Based on DoughyYeast's headcanon

This week has been chaotic art-wise but did some fineliner cheating so you viewers probably can't spot half the mistakes HAH! 
Have a good day day/night/morning/evening, everyone, you're all lovely.
