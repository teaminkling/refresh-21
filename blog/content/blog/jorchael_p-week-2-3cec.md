Week 2: **Deep Ocean**. This art was lovingly created using: **Photoshop**.

## Artist's Notes

At the end of a long twisty cavern a diver finds a little rabbit shrimp thing! How cute and not at all dangerous.

I wanted to design a creature for this week and accidentally made a kaiju looking thing. Space wise I think I messed up translating how deep the ocean is but we can pretend I wanted it to come accross as claustrophobic.
