Week 10: **Folds & Folds**. This art was lovingly created using: **Clip Studio Paint**.

## Artist's Notes

Study of movement and clothing from an incredible performance by Kai during a Freestyle Roulette (link with timestamp cause y'all should watch this performance anyway https://youtu.be/XFUyeYrCcN0?t=280) - this moment was so emotive I just felt pulled to paint it in particular. Clothing and hoomans are not my forte.
