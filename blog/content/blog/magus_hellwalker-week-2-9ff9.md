Week 2: **Deep Ocean**. This art was lovingly created using: **3D Digital**.

## Artist's Notes

Using Blender 3D I created the Greek temple about 6 years ago and always had a vision about creating an underwater scene. Today I accomplished something that resembles an underwater Greek Temple or could it be the edge of Atlantis?
