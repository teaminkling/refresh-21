Drew this earlier at the office since our room didn't have internet since yesterday afternoon. I couldn't think of anything nice, but this came to mind soon enough.

The dance is called "tinikling," where a couple dances between two bamboo poles being clapped to the musical beat. It is somewhat similar to a waltz and a mazurka.
